## There They Go Again ... Again

**Some of the memos I’m happiest about having written came at times when bullish trends went too far, risk aversion disappeared and bubbles inflated.**  The first and best example is probably [“bubble.com,”](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/2000-01-02-bubble.pdf) which raised questions about Internet and e-commerce stocks on the first business day of 2001.  As I tell it, after ten years without a single response, that one made my memo writing an overnight success.

**对于一些我以前写过的备忘录，最令我感到高兴的是写它们的时候都是牛市已经延续很长时间，人们已经渐渐漠视对风险的规避，泡沫正在升起。** 第一个也是最佳的例子或许就是[《bubble.com》](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/2000-01-02-bubble.pdf)，这篇文章在2000年初始就提出了对互联网和电子商务股票的质疑。正如我说的那样，虽然2000年之前十年，我的备忘录都没有得到任何关注，但是这篇文章（《bubble.com》）让我一战成名。

Another was [“The Race to the Bottom”](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/2007-02-14-the-race-to-the-bottom.pdf) (February 2007), which talked about the mindless shouldering of risk that takes place when investors are eager to put money to work.  Both of those memos raised doubts about investment trends that soon turned out to have been big mistakes.

另外一个例子是[《趋底竞赛（The Race to the Bottom）》](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/2007-02-14-the-race-to-the-bottom.pdf)(2007年2月)，这篇备忘录讨论的是当投资者都急迫地想持币入场而产生的风险。这两篇备忘录都对以后被证明是巨大错误，但当时被坚信不疑的投资趋势提出了质疑。

Those are only two of the many cautionary memos I’ve written over the years.  In the last cycle, they started coming two years before [“The Race to the Bottom”](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/2007-02-14-the-race-to-the-bottom.pdf) and included [“There They Go Again”](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/2005-05-06-there-they-go-again.pdf) (the inspiration for this memo’s title), [“Hindsight First, Please”](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/2005-10-17-hindsight-first-please-or-what-where-they-thinking.pdf), [“Everyone Knows”](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/2007-04-26-everyone-knows.pdf) and [“It’s All Good.”](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/2007-07-16-its-all-good.pdf)  When I wrote them, they appeared to be wrong for a while.  It took time before they were shown to have been right, and just too early.

上述只是我这些年写的许多谨慎思考备忘录中的两篇。在上一个周期中，备忘录以危机两年前的《趋底竞赛》为开篇，包括 《重蹈覆辙（there they go again）》（这也是本篇备忘录的灵感来源），《请先学会复盘（Hindsight First, Please）》，《众所周知（Everyone Knows）》和 《一切都还好（It’s All Good）》。当我写这些备忘录时，它们在当时看来好像都是错误的。但是过了一段时间之后它们就会显示出正确性，只不过它们写出来的时间提早了一点而已。

The memos that have raised yellow flags in the current up-cycle, starting with [“How Quickly They Forget”](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/2011-05-25-how-quickly-they-forget.pdf) in 2011 and including [“On Uncertain Ground”](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/2012-09-11-on-uncertain-ground.pdf), [“Ditto”](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/2013-01-07-ditto.pdf), and [“The Race Is On”](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/2013-11-26-the-race-is-on.pdf) also clearly were early, but so far they’re not right (and in fact, when you’re early by six or more years, it’s not clear you can ever be described as having been right). **Since I’ve written so many cautionary memos, you might conclude that I’m just a born worrier who eventually is made to be right by the operation of the cycle, as is inevitable given enough time.  I absolutely cannot disprove that interpretation.** But my response would be that it’s essential to take note when sentiment (and thus market behavior) crosses into too-bullish territory, even though we know rising trends may well roll on for some time, and thus that such warnings are often premature. **I think it’s better to turn cautious too soon (and thus perhaps underperform for a while) rather than too late, after the downslide has begun, making it hard to trim risk, achieve exits and cut losses.**

那些对于目前正处于上升趋势的周期举起小黄旗的备忘录包括：《他们忘得真快（How Quickly They Forget）》，《在不确定的基础上（On Uncertain Ground）》，《重复（Ditto）》，《竞赛开始了（The Race Is On）》这些备忘录毫无例外也过早地的发布了，到目前为止它们仍然没有被验证（事实上，如果在6年或者更长时间之前，你甚至都不知道这些文章未来会不会得到验证）。**因为我已经撰写了过多的保持谨慎的备忘录，你可能得出这样的结论，我是一个天生忧虑的人，只要周期存在，我总会被证明最终是正确的。我绝对无法不同意这种解读。** 我想说的是，当市场情绪（以及市场交易行为）进入过分亢奋的状态时，记录下一些笔记是十分有必要的，即便我们知道这波上升的趋势可能还会持续一段时间，所以当时的一些警告和提醒常常都是早熟的。**我认为早一点警醒（或许可能会带来短时间内的业绩不佳）比很晚才意识到风险要好得多，因为当下跌开始后，我们很难去消化风险，及时退出和减少损失。**

Since I’m convinced “they” are at it again – engaging in willing risk-taking, funding risky deals and creating risky market conditions – it’s time for yet another cautionary memo. **Too soon?  I hope so;** we’d rather make money for our clients in the next year or two than see the kind of bust that gives rise to bargains.  (We all want there to be bargains, but no one’s eager to endure the price declines that create them.)  Since we never know when risky behavior will bring on a market correction, I’m going to issue a warning today rather than wait until one is upon us.

因为我已经确信“它们”现在又重现降临 **——过度的自愿风险承担，为高风险交易提供资金和创造高风险的市场环境——现在是时候再次提示风险和保持警醒了。** 太早了？我希望如此。大家都希望泡沫持续下去，使得我们在未来一两年能继续为客户赚钱，而不希望看到泡沫破裂后一地鸡毛的惨象（**虽然我们都期待能通过泡沫破裂带来便宜资产，但是没人愿意承担价格下跌的代价**）。尽管我们无法知道高风险的交易行为什么时候会带来一次市场的纠正，因此我更希望现在就发出一次预警信号而不是等到真正降临之时。

I’m in the process of writing another book, going into great depth regarding one of the most important things discussed in my book The Most Important Thing: cycles, their causes, and what to do about them.  It will be out next year, but this memo will give you a preview regarding one of the most important cyclical phenomena.

我正在准备我的另一本新书，这本新书讲讨论我在上一本《投资最重要的事》中提到的一个重要话题：周期，周期的成因，以及我们应该怎么应对周期。这本书可能会在明年才能出版，但是其中一种最重要的周期现象，会通过这篇备忘录呈现给大家。

Before starting in, I want to apologize for the length of this memo, almost double the norm.  First, the topic is wide-ranging – so much so that when I sat down to write, I found the task daunting.  Second, my recent vacation gave me the luxury of time for writing.  Believe it or not, I’ve cut what I could.  I think what remains is essential.

在开始之前，我先要对本篇备忘录的长度抱歉，这篇的长度是平时的两倍。首先，讨论的这个话题非常宽广——宽广到当我坐下来写的时候都被吓到了。其次，我最近的休假能够给我时间让我充分写作。不管你相信与否，我已经把这篇文章尽最大可能删减了。我认为留下来的都是精华。

### Today’s Investment Environment（今天的投资环境）

Because I don’t intend this to be a “macro memo,” incorporating a thorough review of the economic and market environment, I’ll merely reference what I think are the four most noteworthy components of current conditions:

因为我不想把这篇备忘录写成“宏观备忘录”，涵盖对经济和市场环境的整体性回顾。我只是简单地提示当前市场环境中四个最值得关注的部分：

- **The uncertainties are unusual in terms of number, scale and insolubility** in areas including secular economic growth; the impact of central banks; interest rates and inflation; political dysfunction; geopolitical trouble spots; and the long-term impact of technology.

  有关数量、规模、不兼容性的不确定性达到了非常水平，这些领域包括停滞的经济增长，央行的政策影响，利率和通胀水平，政治的失效，地缘政治冲突以及科技的长期影响。

- In the vast majority of asset classes, **prospective returns are just about the lowest they’ve ever been.**

  对于大多数资产类别，预期收益都触及历史最低点。

- **Asset prices are high across the board.** Almost nothing can be bought below its intrinsic value, and there are few bargains.In general the best we can do is look for things that are less over-priced than others.

  资产价格在世界范围内普遍偏高。基本上所有资产都很难以低于内在价值的价格买到，而且交易量很少。现在我们能做的最好的事情就是观察那些溢价幅度比别的资产低的机会。

- **Pro-risk behavior is commonplace,** as the majority of investors embrace increased risk as the route to the returns they want or need.

  迎合风险的投资行为比比皆是。大多数投资者为了取得他们需要或者想要的投资回报而拥抱不断上涨的风险。

### Ditto（重复）

In January 2013, I wrote a memo entitled “Ditto.”  Its thrust was that (a) history tends to repeat, (b) thus my memos often return to the same topics and (c) if I’ve handled them well in the past, rather than re-invent the wheel, I might as well borrow from what I’ve written before.  Ergo, “ditto.”

2013年一月，我写过一个题目为《重复》的备忘录。它的要点在于 **（1）历史倾向于重复自己，（2）因此我的备忘录经常会讨论同一个话题（3）如果我过去的备忘录写得足够好，为了避免重复劳动，我很有可能会借用我以前写的东西。** 因此，这就是“重复”。

Few topics are more susceptible to this treatment than the process through which (a) investment fundamentals fluctuate cyclically; (b) investors overreact to the fluctuations; (c) the level of risk aversion incorporated in investor behavior fluctuates between excessive and inadequate; and thus (d) market conditions swing from depressed to elevated and treacherous.  Here’s how I summed up on this topic in “There They Go Again” (May 2005):

以下四个话题都是最容易被重复的：（1）投资的基本面周期性波动（2）投资者对波动的过度反应（3）(投资者过度反应导致的)风险规避水平在极度偏好与极度不足之间摇摆，和（4）市场环境从衰退到膨胀。对于这个话题，我在《重蹈覆辙》中这样写道：

> Given today’s paucity of prospective return at the low-risk end of the spectrum and the solutions being ballyhooed at the high-risk end, many investors are moving capital to riskier (or at least less traditional) investments.  But (a) they’re making those riskier investments just when the prospective returns on those investments are the lowest they’ve ever been; (b) they’re accepting return increments for stepping up in risk that are as slim as they’ve ever been; and (c) they’re signing up today for things they turned down (or did less of) in the past, when the prospective returns were much higher.  This may be exactly the wrong time to add to risk in pursuit of more return.  You want to take risk when others are fleeing from it, not when they’re competing with you to do so.

> **鉴于目前在低风险下缺乏可观投资回报的机会和高风险资产又被过度地吹升，许多投资者开始投入到更具风险性的资产上。** 但是（1）投资者投向的那些高风险资产正处于它们预期投资回报的历史最低点。（2）与投资者承担的风险相比，他们所获得的超额收益之少也达到了历史的低点。（3）投资者现在投资的资产都是过去它们不愿意或者很少投资的东西，而当时这些资产的投资回报还是很可观的。目前这个时点为了追求更高收益而承担更大风险是极为不明智的。你所承担的风险正是别人所抛弃的，而非让他们与你共同面对的。

Do you see any differences between then and now?  Is there any need to redo this description?  Not for me; I think “ditto” will suffice.  I’ll simply go on to borrow the conclusion from “The Race to the Bottom” (February 2007):

你们发现当时和现在有任何区别吗？还有必要重新再写一遍吗？对我来讲是不必要，我觉得“重复”就够了。我简单地借用《趋底竞赛》（2007年2月）的结论：

> **Today’s financial market conditions are easily summed up:  There’s a global glut of liquidity, minimal interest in traditional investments, little apparent concern about risk, and skimpy prospective returns everywhere.  Thus, as the price for accessing returns that are potentially adequate (but lower than those promised in the past), investors are readily accepting significant risk in the form of heightened leverage, untested derivatives and weak deal structures.**  The current cycle isn’t unusual in its form, only its extent.  There’s little mystery about the ultimate outcome, in my opinion, but at this point in the cycle it’s the optimists who look best.

> 今天的金融市场很容易就能够概括：**全球的流动性大泛滥，交易性投资的利差达到极小值，很少有人关心风险，微薄的期望收益到处都是。因此，对于能产生潜在适宜（但是比历史上低的多）投资收益的资产价格，投资者会迅速地接受，同时通过非常高的杠杆率、没有经过测试的衍生品和非常薄弱的交易结构去承担巨大的风险。** 目前的周期从形式上看并没有什么不同，只是在范围上有很大区别。对于最终的结局没有什么悬念，只不过对于目前可能是乐观者认为最好的时点。

### The Seeds for a Boom（繁荣的种子）

My son Andrew worked extensively with me in preparing this memo.  We particularly enjoyed making a list of the elements that typically form the foundation for a bull market, boom or bubble.  We concluded that some or all of the following are necessary conditions.  A few will give us a bull market.  All of them together will deliver a boom or bubble:

我的儿子安德鲁与我一起紧张地为这份备忘录而忙碌。我们非常享受开列有关构成牛市、繁荣和泡沫的基础性元素清单的过程。我们认为下面的这些要素是必需的。如果只具备其中一部分，那么我们能得到一个牛市。如果所有要素都具备，那么将会带来繁荣或者泡沫：

- A benign environment – good results lull investors into complacency, as they get used to having their positive expectations rewarded.Gains in the recent past encourage the heated pursuit of further gains in the future (rather than suggest that past gains might have borrowed from future gains).

  一个优良的环境——好的结果会令投资者自满，这样会让他们习惯于保持积极投资回报预期。近些时候的投资回报会鼓励人们去追求未来更多的回报（过去的回报不会提示投资者这些回报可能就是来自于将来）。

- A grain of truth – the story supporting a boom isn’t created out of whole cloth; it generally coalesces around something real.The seed usually isn’t imaginary, just eventually overblown.

  一些真相——支撑繁荣的故事并不是完全出自于空中楼阁；它一般都会与一些实际发生的事情相关联。牛市的基础一般都不是投资者的幻觉，只不过容易被过度高估。

- Early success – the gains enjoyed by the “wise man in the beginning” – the first to seize upon the grain of truth – tends to attract “the fool in the end” who jumps in too late.

  早期成功——“早期的聪明人”一般都会享受美好结果，那些最早发现并把握住真相的人，通常会吸引那些后来的蠢货来接盘。

- More money than ideas – when capital is in oversupply, it is inevitable that risk aversion dries up, gullibility expands, and investment standards are relaxed.

  钱比点子多——当资本被过度供给时，不可避免地会出现风险规避的丧失，雄心壮志的扩张和投资标准的放松。

- Willing suspension of disbelief – the quest for gain overcomes prudence and deference to history.Everyone concludes “this time it’s different.”No story is too good to be true.

  自愿终止怀疑——对利益的追求战胜了对历史的敬畏和遵从，每个人都认定“这次不一样，好到不像真的”。

- Rejection of valuation norms – all we hear is, “the asset is so great: there’s no price too high.”Buying into a fad regardless of price is the absolute hallmark of a bubble.

  对价值标准的拒绝——我们经常会听到：“这个资产特别好，还没有到顶”，不顾价格的买进绝对是泡沫的典型征兆。

- The pursuit of the new – old timers fare worst in a boom, with the gains going disproportionately to those who are untrammeled by knowledge of the past and thus able to buy into an entirely new future.

  对新东西的追捧——旧时代的产物在繁荣期内表现最差，投资收益出现了非常不均衡地分布，那些不依赖于过去经验的事物收益非常好，大多数人都去买新东西。

- The virtuous circle – no one can see any end to the potential of the underlying truth or how high it can push the prices of related assets.It’s broadly accepted that trees can grow to the sky: “It can only go up.Nothing can stop it.”Certainly no one can picture things taking a turn for the worse.

  良性循环——没人能预测潜在的真相或者相关资产的价格到底有多高。被普遍接受的故事是树能够长到天上去：“它能一直往上长，没人能阻止它。”当然，更没有人能够想象相反的图景是什么样的。

- Fear of missing out – when all the above becomes widespread, optimism prevails and no one can imagine a glitch.That causes most people to conclude that the greatest potential error lies in failing to participate in the current market darling.

  担心错过——当上面提到的所有现象都普遍存在之时，乐观情绪会弥漫开来，没人会想象出故障。这就导致大多数人得出了这样的结论：最大的潜在失误就是没有能够参与到现在的市场中去。


Certainly many of the things listed above are in play today.  Performance has been good – with minor exceptions, quickly rectified – since the beginning of 2009 (that’s more than eight years).  There’s certainly more money around these days than high-return possibilities.  “New ideas” are readily accepted, and some things are viewed as representing virtuous circles.

许多上面提及的东西已经在今天出现了。市场目前表现不错——很小的意外，非常快的修正——从2009年开始（到目前为止已经超过了8年）。现在市场中的钱比存在高收益机会的时候要多的多。“新思想”被迅速地被接纳，一些事情可以被认为体现了善意的循环。

On the other hand, some of the usual ingredients are missing.  Most people (a) are conscious of the uncertainties listed above, (b) recognize that prospective returns are quite skimpy, and (c) accept that things are unlikely to go well forever.  That’s all healthy.

另外一方面，一些构成泡沫的通常因素并未出现。大多数人（1）对上述不确定性还保持清醒，（2）认识到预期的投资回报已经非常狭小（3）都承认事情不可能永远向好。这些都是健康的好现象。

But on the third hand, most people can’t think of what might cause trouble anytime soon.  But it’s precisely when people can’t see what it is that could make things turn down that risk is highest, since they tend not to price in risks they can’t see.  With the negative catalyst so elusive and the return on cash at punitive levels, people worry more about being underinvested or bearing too little risk (and thus earning too low a return in good markets) than they do about losing money.

但是第三方面，大多数人没办法想象什么会给未来造成麻烦。但是正是当人们不知道什么会造成未来转向的时候才是风险最高的时候，因为这个时候大家都不会把看不见的风险因考虑素到价格中去。当负面因素是如此的隐蔽而现金的回报过低，人们更倾向于担心过分谨慎的投资和承担了太少的风险（导致在一个好市场下取得了差的收益）而不是遭受损失。

This combination of elements presents today’s investors with a highly challenging environment.  The result is a world in which assets have appreciated significantly, risk aversion is low, and propositions are accepted that would be questioned if investors were more wary.

这些因素的集合就导致目前投资者置身于一个具有高度挑战性的环境，这样导致的结果是:**世界正处于一个资产已经显著高估，风险规避很少的环境下并且达成了这样的共识：投资者如果警惕性过高将会被质疑。**

Most of what remains for the meat of this memo will consist of descriptions of things afoot in the markets today.  They are intended – as usual with my memos – to be anecdotal and thought-provoking, not complete and scientific.  Think about how many of the things listed above you see in the examples that follow.

备忘录接下来的大部分内容都是有关目前市场上正在进行的事情。像往常一样，对这些事实的记述都是有启发性的，而非完全完整或者科学的。想一想上面提到的事情在接下来的例子中会见到多少。


### U.S. Equities(美国股票)

The good news is that the U.S. economy is the envy of the world, with the highest growth rate among developed nations and a slowdown unlikely in the near term.  The bad news is that this status generates demand for U.S. equities that has raised their prices to lofty levels.

好消息是美国经济令世界羡慕，有着发达国家最快的经济增速，短期内很难看到下滑。坏消息是这种状态产生了对美国股票的需求，使得美国股票的价格上涨到了很高的水平上。

- The S&P 500 is selling at 25 times trailing-twelve-month earnings, compared to a long-term median of 15.

  S&P 500的股票是以25倍的市盈率水平卖出的，而长期中位数水平是15倍。

- The Shiller Cyclically Adjusted PE Ratio stands at almost 30 versus a historic median of 16.  This multiple was exceeded only in 1929 and 2000 – both clearly bubbles.

  Shiller Cyclically Adjusted PE的比值接近30的高位，而历史的中位数水平是16。这一指数只在1929年和2000年有超出，而这两次都是泡沫的前夕。

- While the “p” in p/e ratios is high today, the “e” has probably been inflated by cost cutting, stock buybacks, and merger and acquisition activity.  Thus today’s reported valuations, while high, may actually be understated relative to underlying profits.

  从市盈率指标看，股票价格目前已经很高了，而上市公司盈利水平因为成本的节约、股票的回购以及并购活动而出现了利润的膨胀。相对于实际的潜在利润而言，实际估值要比当前看上去很高的公开市场估值更高

- The “Buffett Yardstick” – total U.S. stock market capitalization as a percentage of GDP – is immune to company-level accounting issues (although it isn’t perfect either).  It hit a new all-time high last month of around 145, as opposed to a 1970-95 norm of about 60 and a 1995-2017 median of about 100.

  “巴菲特刻度”，一个有关美国股票市场资本化水平与GDP的比值，能够免受公司层面会计事件（尽管其表现不佳）影响。这一指标在上个月已经创下历史最高纪录，达到145，与之相对应1970-95的平均水平在60左右而1995-2017的中位数水平大概在100。

- Finally, it can be argued that even the normal historic valuations aren’t merited, since economic growth may be slower in the coming years than it was in the post-World War II period when those norms were established.

  最后，利用传统估值方法得到的结果可能是需要商榷的，毕竟未来几年的经济增长相较于这些方法产生的二战之后，会低很多。

**The thing that is clearest is that the low Fed-mandated short-term interest rates make high valuations seem reasonable.**  When yields are low on fixed income instruments, low earnings yields on equities (that is, low e/p ratios, which equate to high p/e ratios) seem justified.  As Buffett said in February, “Measured against interest rates, stocks actually are on the cheap side compared to historic valuations.”

一件最明显的事是，由于美联储短期基准利率长期保持低位导致了估值水平高企。当固定收益资产的收益是如此的低，股票资产的低收益似乎也是正常的。正如巴菲特二月份说过的那样，“用利率水平去衡量，相较于历史估值水平，股票价格实际上还处于便宜区间。”

But he went on to say, “. . . the risk always is that interest rates go up a lot, and that brings stocks down.”  **Are you happy counting on continued low interest rates for your investment security, especially at a time when the Fed has embarked upon a series of rate increases?** And if interest rates do remain low for several more years, isn’t it likely to be as a result of a lack of vigor in the economy, which would likely cause earnings growth to be sluggish?

但是他继续说到,“…风险总是来自于利率上升很多，这会导致股票价格的下跌。”你还会高兴地继续指望低利率来保障你的投资安全吗？特别是在一个美联储已经明确开始一系列利率抬升措施的时点上？如果利率水平继续在接下来很多年保持低位，这是不是说明经济中实际上是缺乏活力，从而导致实际盈利增长会放缓？

### VIX

The value of an option contract is largely a function of the volatility of the asset under option.  For example, the owner of a “call” has the right – but not the obligation – to buy something at a fixed “strike price.”  Thus he should hope the asset will be volatile: if its price rises a lot, he can buy at the strike price and sell at the new, higher price, locking in a profit.  And what if it goes down a lot?  No matter; he isn’t obligated to buy.

一份期权合同的价格很大程度上是一个有关标的物价格波动率的函数。比如，买权的持有者有权利但没有义务以一定的价格去买入该资产。因此，他应该希望资产价格波动：如果资产价格上升很快，他就能够以约定价格买入，从而在一个新的更高的价格卖出，锁定利润。如果价格下跌呢，没关系，他没有义务去买。

Thus the expected volatility of the underlying asset is a key ingredient in determining the proper price for an option.  For example, everything else being equal, the more volatile an asset is expected to be, the more the buyer of a call should be willing to pay for it (since he participates in the gains but not the losses) and the more the seller of a call should charge for it (since he is forgoing upside potential but retaining downside risk).  This is reflected through option-pricing formulas such as the Black-Scholes Model.

因此有关资产的预期波动率就成为期权合理定价的关键因素。比如，如果所有人都是平等的，一项资产的波动率越大，那么会有更多的人认购买权（以为他只在获利时才会参与而不会在受损时入场），同时会有更多的买权出售方要提高要价（因为他放弃了潜在的上升收益但是依然承担了下滑风险）。上述定价原则可以从Black-Scholes的模型得出。

The formulas can also be used backwards.  Starting with the option price, you can figure out what level of volatility the buyers and sellers are anticipating.  Thus, ever since 1990, the Chicago Board Options Exchange has published the CBOE Volatility Index, or “VIX,” showing how volatile investors in options on the S&P 500 expect it to be over the next 30 days.  The attention paid to the VIX has increased in recent years, and it has come to be called the “complacency index” or the “investor fear gauge.”  When the VIX is low, investors are pricing in stable, tranquil markets, and when it’s high they’re anticipating major ups and downs.

上述公式还能进行反向运用，从期权的价格出发，你能够发现买家和卖家在什么水平上的波动性上进行交易。因此，从1990年开始，芝加哥商品交易所推出了CBOE 波动性指数，也叫VIX，来表现投资者对S&P500股票未来30天内预期的波动率水平。近些年对VIX的关注度在提升，这一指标被称之为“自满指数”或者是“投资者恐惧测度指标”。当VIX指标很低的时候，说明投资者处于一个稳定、平稳的市场之中，当指标很高的时候，说明市场正经历大起大落。

The bottom line is that last week’s VIX was the lowest in its 27-year history – matching a level seen only once before.  The index was last this low when Bill Clinton took office in 1993, at a time when there was peace in the world, faster economic growth and a much smaller deficit.  Should people really be as complacent now as they were then?

VIX指数在上个星期达到了27年来的最低点，一个从来没见到的水平。这一指标上一次到达如此低的水平还发生在克林顿1993年当选总统之时，那个时候世界还很太平，经济增速也很快，另外赤字也还很小。人们真的能如此自信，认为我们现在和当时还一样？

What’s the significance of the VIX, anyway?  Most importantly, it doesn’t say what volatility will be, only what investors think volatility will be.  Thus it’s primarily an indicator of investor sentiment.  In “Expert Opinion” I quoted Warren Buffett as having said, “Forecasts usually tell us more of the forecaster than of the future.”  In a similar way, the VIX tells us more about people’s mood today than it does about volatility tomorrow.

VIX的重要性体现在哪？最重要的是，它并没有预测未来波动性会有多大，而是指反应了投资者认为的波动性该是多大。因此这可以说是一个投资者的情绪指标。在“专家观点”的备忘录中，我曾经引述巴菲特曾经说过的话，“预测通常而言告诉我们更多的是预测者是什么样的，而非未来本身。”同样地，VIX能够告诉我们今天投资者的情绪是怎么样的而非明天的波动率是多少。

All we really know is that implied volatility expectations are low today.  As with most things in investing, the VIX can be subject to multiple interpretations.  As Business Insider wrote on July 18:

我们真正知道的是目前对隐含波动率的预期是如此的低。结合其他投资中最重要的事情，VIX能够有多重解释，正如Business Insider在7月18日写的那样：

> While alarmists may view this [low level of VIX] as a negative — a signal that complacency has made traders vulnerable to an unforeseen shock — many investors simply see it as a byproduct of conditions ideal for stocks to continue edging higher.

> 尽管发出警告的人把VIX的低水平视作负面信号——这信号表明投资者相当自信，对未来看不见的冲击准备相当脆弱，但是许多投资者却简单地将之视为理想化的股票交易环境带来的副产品，而且股票还将继续冲上高位。

I would add one last thing: people extrapolate.  So when volatility has been low, they tend to assume it will be low and build that assumption into the prices for options and assets.  The two are not the same.

我还想增加一点：人们还会不断外推。所以当波动率水平已经很低了，它们会倾向于认为未来还会继续低，并在这一假设下估算期权和资产的价格。然而当下和未来并不相同。

### Super-Stocks(超级股票)

Bull markets are often marked by the anointment of a single group of stocks as “the greatest,” and the attractive legend surrounding this group is among the factors that support the bull move.  When taken to the extreme – as it invariably is – this phenomenon satisfies some of the elements in a boom listed on page four, including:

牛市通常会把一小部分股票吹捧成“最伟大”和最吸引人的传奇，并利用这一小部分股票支持牛市的前行。当这种现象不可避免地走向极端，这现象将会满足第四页中提到的繁荣中的若干要素，包括：

- trust in a virtuous circle incapable of being interrupted;

  盲目相信一个良性循环而不能辨别

- conviction that, given the companies’ fundamental merit, there’s no price too high for their stocks; and

  承认建立在这些公司的基本面健康的基础上，它们的股价没有顶部

- the willing suspension of disbelief that allows investors to extrapolate these positive views to infinity.

  投资者自愿终止了自己对牛市的怀疑，盲目持有乐观情绪指导永远。

In the current iteration, these attributes are being applied to a small group of tech-based companies, which are typified by “the FAANGs”: Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google (now renamed Alphabet).  They all sport great business models and unchallenged leadership in their markets.  Most importantly, they’re viewed as having captured the future and thus as sure to be winners in the years to come.

目前的语境下，这一小部分的股票就是一些科技公司,或者被简化为“FAANGs”的公司：Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix 和Google（现在叫Alphabet）。它们被认为代表着最伟大的商业模式和对它们所在市场的无可挑战的领导力。更重要的是，它们被认为已经抓住了未来，而且一定会在未来成为赢家。

True as far as it goes . . . just as it appeared to be true of the Nifty-Fifty in the 1960s, oil stocks in the ’70s, disk drive companies in the ’80s, and tech/media/telecom in the late ’90s.  But in each of those cases:

因此当我们回溯历史，我们能发现1960年代曾经出现了漂亮50,70年代出现了石油股，80年代涌现出磁盘驱动公司以及90年代默契的科技/传媒/电信股。但是所有这些例子：

- the environment changed in unforeseen ways,

  环境会以意想不到的方式改变

- it turned out that the newness of the business model had hidden its flaws,

  新的商业模式被证明存在隐藏缺陷

- competition arose,

  竞争不断加剧

- excellence in the concept gave rise to weaknesses in execution, and/or

  观念上的先进导致执行上的落后

- it was shown that even great fundamentals can become overpriced and thus give way to massive losses.

  而且还证明，即便是最好的基本面也会面临被高估的情形，并且导致巨大的损失。

The FAANGs are truly great companies, growing rapidly and trouncing the competition (where it exists).  But some are doing so without much profitability, and for others profits are growing slower than revenues.  Some of them doubtless will be the great companies of tomorrow.  But will they all?  Are they invincible, and is their success truly inevitable?

FAANGS确实是伟大的公司，增长迅速且消除了竞争。但是一些公司涉足了没有什么利润的业务，另外一些的利润增长相较于收入的增长很缓慢。其中的一些毫无疑问会是未来伟大的公司，但是它们会全部都是吗？它们真的是不可战胜的吗？它们的成功真的是不可阻挡的吗？

The prices investors are paying for these stocks generally represent 30 or more years of the companies' current earnings. There are clear reasons to be excited about their growth in the near term, but what about the durability of earnings over the long term, where much of the value in a high-multiple stock necessarily lies?  Andrew points out that the iPhone is just ten years old, and twenty years ago the Internet wasn't in widespread use.  That raises the question of whether investors in technology can really see the future, and thus how happy they should be paying prices that incorporate optimistic assumptions regarding long-term earnings power.  Of course, this may just mean the best is yet to come for these fairly young companies.

投资者为股票支付的价格一般来说代表了这家公司三十甚至更多年的当期盈利。如果股票在短期内上涨当然是值得惊喜的，但是这些盈利在长期的持久性又是怎么样呢?股票的绝大多数价值恰恰就在于长期。安德鲁指出iPhone才仅仅出现了十年，二十年前甚至连互联网都没有大规模使用。那么问题就来了，科技领域投资者真的能看到未来吗？如果能看到未来，投资者投资这些隐含了巨额长期盈利预期假设的公司的时候肯定无比高兴。当然了，如果他们真这样做，或许只能让那些年轻创业公司乐坏了。

Here’s a passage from one company’s 1997 letter to shareholders:

**这里是一家公司在1997年给股东的一封信：**


> We established long-term relationships with many important strategic partners, including America Online, Yahoo!, Excite, Netscape, GeoCities, AltaVista, @Home, and Prodigy.

> 我们和很多重要的战略伙伴建立了长期的合作关系，包括美国在线，雅虎，Excite搜索引擎，网景公司，GeoCities，AltaVista,@Home，Prodigy.

How many of these “important strategic partners” still exist in a meaningful way today (leaving aside the question of whether they’re important or strategic)?  The answer is _zero_ (unless you believe Yahoo! satisfies the criteria, in which case the answer is one).  The source of the citation is Amazon’s 1997 annual report, and the bottom line is that the future is unpredictable, and nothing and no company is immune to glitches.

这些“重要的合作伙伴”有几个到目前为止还有存在的意义呢（且不用说他们的重要性）？答案是零，除非你认为雅虎还勉强符合标准，那么答案就是一。这个引用的来源是亚马逊1997年的年报。我想说的是未来是无法预测的，没任何一个人没有公司能在预测未来上不犯错。

The super-stocks that lead a bull market inevitably become priced for perfection.  And in many cases the companies’ perfection turns out eventually to be either illusory or ephemeral.  Some of the “can’t lose” companies of the Nifty-Fifty were ultimately crippled by massive changes in their markets, including Kodak, Polaroid, Xerox, Sears and Simplicity Pattern (do you see many people sewing their own clothes these days?).  Not only did the perfection that investors had paid for evaporate, but even the successful companies’ stock prices reverted to more-normal valuation multiples, resulting in sub-par equity returns.

那些引领牛市的超级股票，不可避免的在定价的时候被投资者想像得过于完美。很多情况下，这些“完美”最终会被发现只是一种短暂的幻觉。那些曾经被认为不可能会被打败的“漂亮50”公司，最终还是被剧烈的市场变化毁灭了，比如柯达，宝丽来，西尔斯[5]，Simplicity Pattern[6]（现在真的还有人自己缝自己的衣服吗？）。不仅仅是投资者投向这些所谓的“完美公司”的资金灰飞烟灭了，那些依旧成功的公司股价在冲高后依旧会回调到正常水平，导致投资者收益跑输基准。

**The powerful multiple expansion that makes a small number of stocks the leaders in a bull market is often reversed in the correction that follows, saddling them with the biggest losses.  But when the mood is positive and things are going well, the likelihood of such a development is easily overlooked.**

那种引领牛市的，股价巨额增长的小部分公司，最终价格都会修复到正常水平，同时伴随着巨额的损失。但是当市场情绪普遍乐观一切看起来都很美好的时候，这种可能性经常被投资者忽视。

Finally, a rationale often arises to the effect that, thanks to market technicals, investors’ powerful buying of the leading stocks is sure to continue non-stop, meaning they can’t help but remain the best performers.  In the tech bubble of the late 1990’s, for example, investors concluded that:

最后，当投资者疯狂追捧那些引领牛市的股票的时候，很多人都坚信这种情况肯定会持续下去，并为这种情况辩护。就像90年代末互联网泡沫时候投资者总结的那样：

- stocks were doing so well that they would continue to attract capital,

  股价肯定会表现得好，因为他们会持续吸引资本

- since tech companies and tech stocks were the best performers, they were sure to continue attracting a disproportionate share of the new buying,

  因为科技公司表现最好，它们一定会不成比例得吸引新入市资金

- the superior performance of the tech stocks would cause more of them to be added to the stock indices,

  这些科技股优秀的表现会吸引更多资本进入市场

- this would require index funds and closet indexers to direct a rising share of their buying to tech stocks,

  这些科技股优秀的表现，会让那些被动指数投资者增加它们在科技股中的投资比重。

- in order to keep up with the returns on the indices, benchmark-conscious active managers would have to respond by increasing their tech stock holdings, and,

  为了跟上这些科技股的回报率不至于跑输指数，主动投资基金经理一样需要加仓科技股。

- thus tech stocks couldn’t fail to attract an ever-rising share of buying, and were sure to keep outperforming.

  这样看来科技股不太会下跌，还会继续跑赢市场。

**You can call this a virtuous circle or a perpetual motion machine.  It’s the kind of thing that fires investors’ imaginations in a bull market.**  But the logic that says it will work forever always collapses, sometimes just under its own weight, as was the case in 2000.

你可以管这个叫“良性循环”或者“永动机”。这种东西往往会在牛市中点燃投资者的情绪。但是逻辑告诉我们这种东西是不可持续的，股价会被自身的重力压垮，就像2000年那样。

**Many of the most important considerations in investing are counterintuitive.  One of those is the ability to understand that no market, niche or group is likely to outperform the others forever.**  Given human nature, “the best” will always come eventually to be overpriced, even for their stellar fundamentals.  Thus even if the fundamentals hold up, the stocks’ performance from those too-high prices will become ordinary.  And if they turn out not really to have been the best – or if their business falters – the combination of fundamental decline and multiple contraction can be really painful.

很多最重要的投资理念往往是反直觉的。其中之一就是理解没有任何一个股票，市场，投资品种能够永远跑赢其他投资标的。因为人的天性，“最好”的东西往往会被高估。哪怕他们真的非常非常好，它们的价值也才勉强配得上这些股票的超高定价。而一旦发现这些股票没有达到“最好”，或者犯了一些错误，股价的基础就会崩塌。

**I’m not saying the FAANGs aren’t great, or that they’ll suffer such a fate.  Just that their elevated status today is a sign of the kind of investor optimism for which we must be on the lookout.**

我并不是说FAANG不伟大，或者他们的股价终将崩塌。只是说我们需要多加注意，因为他们如今的崛起标志着投资者的一种乐观情绪。

### Passive Investing/ETFs(被动投资和ETF)

Fifty years ago, shortly after arriving at the University of Chicago for graduate school, I was taught that thanks to market efficiency, (a) assets are priced to provide fair risk-adjusted returns and (b) no one can consistently find the exceptions.  In other words, “you can’t beat the market.”  Our professors even advanced the idea of buying a little bit of each stock as a can’t-fail, low-cost way to outperform the stock-pickers.

五十年前，在抵达芝加哥大学读研之后，老师告诉我因为市场的有效性存在，资产往往都被赋予了一个合理的风险回报比率，没有人能持续获得超额收益。换句换说，你打不败市场。我的教授甚至更进一步，认为把每种股票都买一点是一种不会失败，低成本的手段，足以击败主动投资者。

John Bogle put that suggestion into practice.  Having founded Vanguard a year earlier, he launched the First Index Investment Trust in 1975, the first index fund to reach commercial scale.  As a vehicle designed to emulate the S&P 500, it was later renamed the Vanguard 500 Index Fund.

约翰·博格尔（John Bogle）实践了这种想法。在成立美国先锋集团（Vanguard Group）一年之前，他于1975年成立了第一指数投资信托(First Index Investment Trust)，这是第一家达到了商业规模的指数基金。作为一个复制标准普尔500的基金，它后来被命名为先锋500指数基金（Vanguard 500 Index Fund）。

The concept of indexation, or passive investing, grew gradually over the next four decades, until it accounted for 20% of equity mutual fund assets in 2014.  Given the generally lagging performance of active managers over the last dozen or so years, as well as the creation of ETFs, or exchange-traded funds, which make transacting simpler, the shift from active to passive investing has accelerated.  Today it’s a powerful movement that has expanded to cover 37% of equity fund assets.  In the last ten years, $1.4 trillion has flowed into index mutual funds and ETFs (and $1.2 trillion out of actively managed mutual funds).

指数化投资，被动投资的理念在之后四十年不断发展壮大，直到2014年20%的对冲基金资产都是指数化投资。因为主动投资基金经理持续跑输指数，再加上ETF的发明，让指数投资更加简单。这种主动投资转向被动投资的趋势开始加速。目前37%的基金财产都已经是指数化被动化投资。在过去十年，1.4万亿美元进入了指数对冲基金和ETF，1.2万亿美元流出了主动管理基金。

Like all investment fashions, passive investing is being warmly embraced for its positives:

像其他投资潮流一样，被动投资广受欢迎主要因为以下几个优点：

- Passive portfolios have outperformed active investing over the last decade or so.

  被动组合在过去几十年一直跑赢主动组合

- With passive investing you’re guaranteed not to underperform the index.

  被动投资保证你不会跑输指数

- Finally, the much lower fees and expenses on passive vehicles are certain to constitute a permanent advantage relative to active management.

  更低的管理费用是被动投资对主动投资的永久的巨大优势

Does that mean passive investing, index funds and ETFs are a no-lose proposition?  Certainly not:

但是被动投资真的不会失败吗？当然不：

- While passive investors protect against the risk of underperforming, they also surrender the possibility of outperforming.

  首先被动投资放弃了超额收益的可能性

- The recent underperformance on the part of active investors may well prove to be cyclical rather than permanent.

  近期部分主动投资者业绩开始超越被动投资者，两种投方式更像一种循环而不是永久的趋势

- As a product of the last several years, ETFs’ promise of liquidity has yet to be tested in a major bear market, particularly in less-liquid fields like high yield bonds.

  ETF的历史较短，它向投资者保证的高流动性还没有经过熊市的考验，尤其是在高收益债券领域的流动性

Here are a few more things worth thinking about:

**这里还有其他几点需要考虑一下：**

**Remember, the wisdom of passive investing stems from the belief that the efforts of active investors cause assets to be fairly priced – that’s why there are no bargains to find.  But what happens when the majority of equity investment comes to be managed passively?**  Then prices will be freer to diverge from “fair,” and bargains (and over-pricings) should become more commonplace.  This won’t assure success for active managers, but certainly it will satisfy a necessary condition for their efforts to be effective.

记住，被动投资的理论源于相信市场上的产品在主动投资者的努力下都被合理定价，这也是为什么市场上不存在超额收益的原因。但是当大多数投资者都转向被动投资的时候会发生什么？这样一来市场的定价就不会再合理了，超额收益将会越来越普遍。这并不是说主动投资经理一定会成功，但是他们的策略一定会越来越有效。

One of my clients, the chief investment officer of a pension fund, told me the treasurer had proposed dumping all active managers and putting the whole fund into index funds and ETFs.  My response was simple: ask him how much of the fund he’s comfortable having in assets no one is analyzing.

我的一个客户，一个养老基金的CIO，告诉我委托人提议他把所有主动投资经理开除，全部转向指数基金和ETF。我的回答很简单，问他你愿意把多少资金投在一个没有任何人在分析研究的基金？

As Steven Bregman of Horizon Kinetics puts it, “basket-based mechanistic investing” is blindly moving trillions of dollars.  ETFs don’t have fundamental analysts, and because they don’t question valuations, they don’t contribute to price discovery.  **Not only is the number of active managers’ analysts likely to decline if more money is shifted to passive investing, but people should also wonder about who’s setting the rules that govern passive funds’ portfolio construction.**

正如Horizon Kinetics公司的Steven Bregman说过，“基于股票篮子的投资就像是闭着眼管理上万亿资金”。ETF并没有任何研究者，它们从来不质疑估值，也不为价格发现做出任何贡献。问题不仅仅是主动投资经理的数量会随着资金大量转向被动投资而减少，我们还必须思考这种情况下，是谁在决定被动投资组合的成份。

The low fees and expenses that make passive investments attractive mean their organizers have to emphasize scale.  To earn higher fees than index funds and achieve profitable scale, ETF sponsors have been turning to “smarter,” not-exactly-passive vehicles.  Thus ETFs have been organized to meet (or create) demand for funds in specialized areas such as various stock categories (value or growth), stock characteristics (low volatility or high quality), types of companies, or geographies.  There are passive ETFs for people who want growth, value, high quality, low volatility and momentum.  Going to the extreme, investors now can choose from funds that invest passively in companies that have gender-diverse senior management, practice “biblically responsible investing,” or focus on medical marijuana, solutions to obesity, serving millennials, and whiskey and spirits.

低管理费让被动投资更具吸引力，同时也意味着被动投资的基金经理必须更注重管理资产的规模。为了能比指数基金的经理挣更多的管理费，达到可以盈利的水平，ETF的管理者需要变得更加“聪明”，不仅仅做一个被动投资的通道。于是出现了一些ETF，专门迎合一些基金对某些特定领域的需求，比如对不同种类股票的投资需求（价值还是成长），对不同特征股票的投资需求（低波动还是高质量），对不同地区的股票的需求，不同行业的股票的需求。这种情况发展到极限，投资者甚至可以选择专门投资“管理层男女比例平衡公司”的被动投资基金，专门投资“信仰虔诚公司”的被动基金，专门投资“解决医用大麻/肥胖问题的公司”的被基金，专门投资“千禧一代相关公司”的被动基金等等。

But what does “passive” mean when a vehicle’s focus is so narrowly defined? **Each deviation from the broad indices introduces definitional issues and non-passive, discretionary decisions.** Passive funds that emphasize stocks reflecting specific factors are called “smart-beta funds,” but who can say the people setting their selection rules are any smarter than the active managers who are so disrespected these days? Bregman calls this “semantic investing,” meaning stocks are chosen on the basis of labels, not quantitative analysis. There are no absolute standards for which stocks represent many of the characteristics listed above.

但是当一个被动投资基金的投资范围如此狭窄的时候，它还是真正的“被动基金”吗？每一个和整个股票市场组合不同的投资组合肯定都会引入非被动的成分，有主观的考量。这些注重于某些特殊种类股票的被动基金被称为“smart-beta基金”。但是谁敢说这些制定股票筛选标准的smart-beta基金经理比那些备受鄙视的主动投资经理高明呢。Bregman把这种投资称之为“语义学投资（“semantic investing）”，意思是这些投资完全基于这些股票的语言标签，而不是量化的分析。没有一个绝对的标准能够确保你选择的股票符合你要求的公司特质。

Importantly, organizers wanting their “smart” products to reach commercial scale are likely to rely heavily on the largest-capitalization, most-liquid stocks. For example, having Apple in your ETF allows it to get really big. Thus Apple is included today in ETFs emphasizing tech, growth, value, momentum, large-caps, high quality, low volatility, dividends, and leverage.

重要的是，管理者希望他们的“聪明”的产品能够达到商业化的规模，但是这又要求他们必须严重依赖那些高市值，流动性好的股票。举个例子，只有你的ETF包括了苹果公司这种股票，你才能把市值做得非常大。目前仅苹果一家公司，就被选入了那些专注于“成长”“科技”“价值”“栋梁”“高市值”“高质量”“低波动”“高分红”的ETF。

Here’s what Barron’s had to say earlier this month:

这是Barron这个月早些时候说的话：

> With cap-weighted indexes, index buyers have no discretion but to load up on stocks that are already overweight (and often pricey) and neglect those already underweight. That’s the opposite of buy low, sell high.

> 对于那些市值权重指数，指数投资者实际上没有选择，全部挤在了那些已经权重过高（经常同时过贵）的股票上，而更加忽略了那些早就被低估的股票。这和买低卖高的原则完全相反。

The large positions occupied by the top recent performers – with their swollen market caps – mean that as ETFs attract capital, they have to buy large amounts of these stocks, further fueling their rise. **Thus, in the current up-cycle, over-weighted, liquid, large-cap stocks have benefitted from forced buying on the part of passive vehicles, which don’t have the option to refrain from buying a stock just because its overpriced.**

大量的仓位被那些最近表现最好的公司所占据，也意味着当ETF吸引到资金的时候，他们也被迫继续购买这些表现最好的股票，进一步助推了它们股价的上涨。因此在目前的上升周期，权重过高、流动性好、大市值的股票从这种被动投资基金的被迫购买行为中获得巨大的收益。目前来如果一个股票的价格已经被过于高估，我们没有办法去阻止这种趋势。

**Like the tech stocks in 2000, this seeming perpetual motion machine is unlikely to work forever.** If funds ever flow out of equities and thus ETFs, what has been disproportionately bought will have to be disproportionately sold. **It’s not clear where index funds and ETFs will find buyers for their over-weighted, highly appreciated holdings if they have to sell in a crunch.  In this way, appreciation that was driven by passive buying is likely to eventually turn out to be rotational, not perpetual.**

就像是2000年的科技股，这种看起来完全无法阻挡的永动机也不会一直工作下去。如果资金开始流出ETF，ETF不成比例的买入也会变成完全不成比例的卖出。如果真出现挤兑的情况，不知道这些ETF会从哪里去找人给他们持有的大幅被高估的权重股票接盘。这么看来，由被动购买支撑的股票价格上升看起来最终会变成一种循环，而不是单调上升。

Finally, the systemic risks to the stock market have to be considered.  Bregman calls “the index universe a big, crowded momentum trade.”  A handful of stocks – the FAANGs and a few more – are responsible for a rising percentage of the S&P’s gains, meaning the stock market’s health may be overstated.

最后，股票市场的系统性风险也需要考虑。Bregman说“指数就是一个巨大的拥挤的动量投资”。少数几个股票，比如FANNGS和其它一小撮股票在标准普尔500中的比重越来越大。股票市场整体的健康性可能被我们高估。

All the above factors raise questions about the likely effectiveness of passive vehicles – and especially smart-beta ETFs.

以上所有问题让我们不禁疑惑：被动投资工具的有效性究竟怎么样？尤其是那些smart-beta ETF。

- Is Apple a safe stock or a stock that has performed well of late?  Is anyone thinking about the difference?

  苹果是一个安全的股票，还是一个从长期看表现一直会非常好的股票?有人想过其中的区别吗？

- Are investors who invest in a number of passive vehicles described in different ways likely to achieve the diversification, liquidity and safety they expect?

  那些投资于不同表述的被动投资工具的投资者，真的达到了他们想要的分散风险，提高流动性，提高安全性的目标吗？

- **And what should we think about the willingness of investors to turn over their capital to a process in which neither individual holdings nor portfolio construction is the subject of thoughtful analysis and decision-making, and in which buying takes place regardless of price?**

  我们是不是应该思考一下，投资者内心真的想要把自己的资金交给一个没有任何投资组合构建、个股选择、分析师参与、投资决策的投资过程吗？而在这个过程中，他们买入股票甚至从来不考虑股票的价格？

### Credit

Corporate debt instruments are good candidates for spotting bull-market behavior given that (unlike equities, for example), we can readily determine their prospective returns.  We know that, as described in [“The Race to the Bottom”](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/2007-02-14-the-race-to-the-bottom.pdf) in overpopulated markets providers of credit compete to make loans and investments that embody low returns, weak structures and slender margins of safety.

和股市比起来，在公司负债工具市场，你很容易发现牛市的到来，因为我们可以轻易地确定债券的预期收益。我们知道，就像在《趋底竞赛》一书中说的那样，在一个过度拥挤的市场，信用的提供者倾向于提供回报率低，结构脆弱，安全边际小的资产和贷款。

Whatever the level of fundamental risk, sometimes the reward for bearing it is demonstrably inadequate, and sometimes it is highly excessive. **It’s an over-simplification, but sometimes I think we could base our strategic decisions almost exclusively on the relationship between risk in the market and investors’ willingness to bear it.**

不论信用风险的大小如何，有时候市场承担这种风险的意愿会非常低，有时会非常高。或许我这种方法过于简单，但是有时候我们确实可以仅仅基于市场上存在的风险和投资者承担风险的意愿去做投资决定。

It’s very helpful to know – and a lot of my new book will be about – where we stand in that swing.  In that regard, I’ll remind you that “The Race to the Bottom” was prompted by a Financial Times article about U.K. banks’ willingness to compete for mortgage business by increasing the multiple of annual income they would lend.  Earlier this month, ironically, I read the following in another London newspaper, the Daily Mail:

就像我之后几本新书会讲的，知道我们处于“风险和承担风险的意愿”这个平衡中的那个位置对投资是非常重要的。《趋底竞赛》一书的灵感，就是来源于一篇《金融时报》上的关于英国银行为了竞争贷款业务主动加杠杆的意愿的文章。这个月初。比较讽刺的是，我又读到了另一篇伦敦报纸《每日邮报》上的文章：

> In a chilling echo of the sub-prime mortgage crisis of 2007, car finance firms packaged and sold £5.5 billion of risky loan debt to investors last year – twice as much as the year before.

> 在2007年金融海啸的余波阴影中，汽车金融公司去年打包并向投资者销售了55亿英镑风险贷款，几乎是去年的两倍。

**Such eagerness to finance low-quality loans will always be a sign of elevated, over-financed, risk-oblivious credit markets.** At the late-2008 trough of the financial crisis, high yield bonds and leveraged loans yielded almost 2,000 basis points more than comparable Treasurys, meaning anyone who bought and held couldn’t really lose.  Then, as investors recovered their equilibrium and bought, prices rose and the yield spread contracted.  Now the spread is merely average relative to history – a few hundred basis points.  The net yields on these securities are still highly likely to be well in excess of those on Treasurys, but any capital appreciation would have to come from further spread contraction, and that certainly can’t be counted upon.

这种对于低质量贷款的渴望是一种不断上升的，过度金融化的，风险明显的信贷市场的标志。在2008年末的金融海啸低谷期，高收益债券和杠杆贷款收益超过了国债2000个bp，意味着任何人买入并持有这些债券都不会亏损。紧接着，随着投资者和市场重新恢复平衡，债券价格上升，利差开始缩小。现在利差大概达到了历史平均水平，几百个bp左右。这些债券的收益率肯定会继续高于国债，但是资本升值只能通过利差进一步缩短获得，这显然是不靠谱的。

The credit investors of today clearly aren’t gun-shy, leaving investment opportunities to languish at excessive yields and yield spreads.  At best these investments are fairly priced today in relative terms and fully priced – offering low returns like everything else – in absolute terms.

现在的信用投资者显然不是金融海啸时期那样风声鹤唳的，不会放过任何的超额收益和超额回报。最好的情况下，这些投资的相对收益已经得到了合理的定价，绝对收益已经得到了充分的定价（和其他资产一样低）。

I’ll use an example to illustrate the acceptance being accorded low-grade credit instruments.  In early May, Netflix issued €1.3 billion of Eurobonds, the lowest-cost debt it ever issued.  The interest rate was 3.625%, the covenants were few, and the rating was single-B.  Netflix’s GAAP earnings run about $200 million per quarter, but according to Grant’s Interest Rate Observer, in the year that ended March 31, Netflix burned through $1.8 billion of free cash flow.  It’s an exciting company, but as Grant’s reminded its readers, bondholders can’t participate in gains, just losses. **Given this asymmetrical proposition, any bond issue should be characterized by solidity and a meaningful promised return, not the sex appeal of its issuer.**

我会用一个简单的例子说明低评级信贷工具已经完全被市场接受。在五月，Netflix发型了13亿的欧元债券，这是该公司历史上发行的最低成本的债券。利率是3.625%，附加条款很少，评级是B。Netflix的GAAP收入大约是每季度2亿美金，但是根据《格兰特利率观察家》报道，在上一个季度，Netflix已经烧掉了18亿美金的自由现金流。这是个很好的公司，但是就像《格兰特利率观察家》提醒读者的那样，债券投资者不能从公司获得超额收益，只会承担超额损失。正是由于债券收益和损失不对称这个特点，任何债券发行都必须基于坚实的回报，而不是它的发行人的魅力。

Is it prudent to lend money to a company that goes through it at such a prodigious rate?  Will Amazon or Google be able to loosen Netflix’s hold on its customers?  Is it wise to buy bonds based on a technology position that could be overtaken?  Positive investor sentiment has taken the company’s equity value to $70 billion; what would happen to the bond price if worries about rising competition took a bite out of that one day? **Should you take these risks to make less than 4% per year?  In Oaktree’s view, this isn’t a solid debt investment; it’s an equity-linked digital content investment totally lacking in upside potential, and it’s not for us.  The fact that deals like this can get done easily should tell you something about today’s market climate.**

投资这样一家公司是不是慎重的决定呢？亚马逊和谷歌会不会挖走Netflix的用户群呢？购买一个基于可以被取代技术的公司是不是明智的呢？乐观的投资者已经把这家公司的估值提高到700亿美金了。如果有一天大家开始担忧这家公司将会受到强有力的竞争，它的债券价格会发生什么呢？你应该去为了不到4%的利润去承担这么大的风险吗？在橡树资本看来，这根本不是一个稳妥的债券投资，这是一个和股票权益挂钩的，基于线上数字内容的，没有超额收益的投资，并不适合我们。这样一种交易能够迅速达成，你应该能明白现在市场上是什么样一种氛围了吧。

Finally, let’s consider whether risk tolerance and carefree behavior are isolated or widespread in today’s credit market.  Here are some quotes from a July 14 article by Lisa Abramowicz of Bloomberg Gadfly (emphasis added):

最后，我们来想一下风险容忍和不负责任的投资是孤立还是广泛存在于现在的信贷市场。这里有一些7月14号Bloomberg上Lisa Abramowicz的文章的节选：

> Over the last eight years, junk-rated corporate debt has been transformed from a fringe asset to a staple for many fixed-income investors.  As they’ve become more popular, these risky bonds and loans have increasingly lost a feature that made them so attractive (and lucrative) – the investor protections known as covenants written into the documents that govern the debt.  These are aimed at ensuring investors can recover their money if the company fails.

> 在过去80年，垃圾债逐渐从固定收益投资者次要的资产变成了主要的资产。随着垃圾债越来越流行，这些风险资产的吸引力正在快速下降（收益）。而对于投资者的保护条款，以契约的形式保证了投资者在公司倒闭后也能获得一部分收益。

> Last month, the $26.9 billion of junk bonds sold had the highest proportion of deals on record with weak investor protections, Moody’s Investor Service reported this week.  About 60 percent of the risky U.S. corporate bonds sold had few protections written into their deal documents, Moody’s said.  In the leveraged-loan market, nearly three quarters of the debt is “covenant lite” after three years of record issuance . . .

> 穆迪投资者服务部门报告，上个月就有269亿垃圾债发行，占市场的比重创造了记录，但是投资者保护却非常薄弱。按照穆迪的说法，60%的美国风险企业债在没有什么保护条款存在的情况下被卖了出去。杠杆贷款市场在最近三年创纪录的发行之后，75%的的信贷只存在“精简”的契约。

> **Investors have grown so confident about the seemingly interminable corporate-debt rally that many are dismissing the likelihood of large swaths of risky companies going bankrupt.  After all, these covenants usually don’t matter until there’s a problem.**

> 投资者对于这没完没了的公司债盛宴变得如此自信，以至于很多人都不在意这些公司破产的风险。毕竟这些投资者保护条款在真正出现问题之前，总是无关紧要的。

It’s a standard cycle: cautious investing produces good performance in a salutary environment . . . which leads to a reduction of caution . . . which leads to bad performance when the environment turns less favorable.  This is part of the race to the bottom I wrote about in 2008.

这是一个标准的循环：谨慎的投资在有利的市场环境下取得了较好的回报，然后投资就开始变得没那么谨慎……直到市场环境转向不利，给投资者带来了糟糕的表现。这就是我评价2008年危机时说的“趋底竞赛”的一部分。

### Emerging Market Debt(新兴市场债务)

The emerging markets are another place where investor opinion fluctuates wildly and visibly.  “Everyone knows” the emerging markets have more growth potential than the developed world, but attitudes regarding the realizability of that potential – and thus the price one should pay for it – gyrate wildly over time.

另一个投资者观点会大幅且显著波动的地方就是新兴市场国家。“每个人都知道”新兴市场国家的发展潜力比发达国家要大，但是对这种潜力的可实现性（以及为此应付出的代价）的态度随着时间的推移而会发生急剧变化。

I described the phenomenon in [“The Role of Confidence”](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/2013-08-05-the-role-of-confidence.pdf) (August 2013).  When confidence is running high, the emerging markets are viewed as being just like developed markets, only faster-growing, meaning it’s reasonable for their securities to sell at yields and p/e ratios like those in the developed world.  But when confidence declines, it becomes clear that there are risks that don’t exist in the developed world – like coups, institutionalized corruption, maxi-devaluation and debt repudiation – and thus significant valuation discounts are in order.  Again, as with corporate credit, which is this? **Are investors appropriately sensitive to the risks and imposing reasonable discounts, or are they ignoring the risks and happily paying up?  That’s a lot of what you have to know.**

我在《信心的作用》（2013年8月）中描述了这种现象。**当市场信心高涨时，新兴市场国家被视为等同于发达市场，只有快速增长，这意味着新兴市场国家的证券以发达国家的收益率和市盈率水平出售是合理的。** 但是，当市场信心下降时，我们很容易发现新兴市场国家所暴露出来的、发达国家所不具有的风险：例如政变，制度化腐败，最大化贬值和拒绝偿债，因此显著的估值折扣有序而至。就像企业信用的问题一样，我们再想想这属于哪种情况？是投资者对风险保有适当敏感性并施加合理的折扣，还是投资者忽视风险并乐意为其（市场风险暴露）买单？这里面有很多你需要知道的事情。

To answer the question, I’ll make reference to $2.75 billion of bonds that were issued by Argentina in mid-June.  The maturity was 100 years – “century bonds” – and the interest rate was 8%.

为了回答这个问题，我将参考阿根廷政府在今年6月中旬发行的27.5亿美元的债券进行说明。阿根廷政府所发行的债券为期限长达100年、票面利率为8%的“世纪债券”。

You might have thought this would be a hard thing to sell.  After all, Argentina had defaulted on its debts eight times in its 200-year history, with no fewer than five defaults in the past century alone, most recently in 2014 amid a legal dispute with the Elliott hedge fund. . . .

你可能认为对于阿根廷来说出售这支债券并非易事。毕竟在其200年的历史中，阿根廷政府已经违约八次，在过去一个世纪内违约事件也不下五次。最近的一次违约事件还是2014年与埃利奥特对冲基金的法律纠纷。

>But investors do not seem to care: there were $9.75bn of bids.  And Argentina is not the only peculiar event in bond markets this month.  Take a look, for example, at Ivory Coast.  In recent weeks, this West African nation underwent yet another military uprising.  But this month it sold 16-year bonds with a 6.25 per cent yield – and these were also heavily oversubscribed.  Places such as Senegal and Egypt have also seen hot demand for their debt.  (Financial Times, June 27)

>但投资者似乎对此并不在意：97.75亿美元的投标正是证明。阿根廷发行政府债券并不是本月债券市场上唯一一例特别事件。举例来说，科特迪瓦这个西非国家在最近几周内又爆发了一起军事冲突，但这并不影响科特迪瓦政府发行期限为16年、票面利率为6.25％的债券，并且这些债券也被超额认购。 市场对塞内加尔和埃及这些国家的债务需求也很高。（摘自《金融时报》6月27日）

To conclude on this subject, I can’t resist citing (but am too polite to name) the head of research and strategy for a likewise-unnamed broker/investment bank:

总而言之，我不得不引用（有点太客气了）一位不知名经纪人/投资银行的研究和策略负责人的话：

>“It’s just shocking that they exit default and their bond issue is a century bond,” said [Ms. X]. . .  Nevertheless, she is advising her clients to buy the bonds as at least a short term trade.

X女士说，“阿根廷政府能不受违约事件影响并发行世纪债券，这太令人震惊了”。不过，她仍然建议她的客户购买这些债券，因为至少可以短期持有。

Let me get this straight: it’s incredible that Argentina is able to issue this thing, but it’s a good buy for a moment. **It’s a sign of the times: “something may go wrong, but probably not soon.”** I much prefer Warren Buffett’s view: “If you aren’t willing to own a stock for ten years, don’t even think about owning it for ten minutes.”

一言以蔽之，阿根廷政府能够发行这样的债券着实不可思议，但是从当时来看这似乎是一个比较好的购买标的。这件事正说明这个时代存在的一个怪相：（投资者认为）有些事可能会出错，但可能不会那么快暴露出来。对于此，我更偏向于巴菲特的观点：“如果你不愿意拥有一只股票十年,那就不要考虑拥有它十分钟”。

For only the third time in history, emerging market debt is selling at yields below those on U.S. high yield bonds.  Is Argentina, a country that defaulted five times in the last hundred years (and once in the last five), likely to get through the next hundred without a rerun?

这是历史上第三次出现新兴市场国家债券收益率低于美国高收益债券的收益率的情况。像阿根廷这样在过去的一百年里违约五次（在过去五年内违约过一次）的国家，能成功度过下一个一百年而不出现任何违约吗？

**The essential bottom line in all investing is simple: is the risk premium at least adequate?** Can we answer in the affirmative with regard to emerging market debt today?

所有投资的基本要点都很简单：风险溢价至少是否足够？对于这个问题，我们能否就今天的新兴市场债务问题给出肯定答案？

### Private Equity(私募股权)

In today’s low-return world, it’s clear that institutional investors needing 7-8% a year aren’t likely to get it from Treasurys yielding 1-2%, high grades at 3-4%, or mainstream stocks that most people expect to return 5-6%.  Heck, you can’t even get it from Ivory Coast bonds!  Where is one to turn?

在目前的低利率背景下，目标年化收益率为7%-8％的机构投资者很难通过收益水平仅有1%-2％的国债（更高一点的话为3%-4%），或多数人期望的收益率达5%-6％的主流股票来实现目标。哎，你甚至不要寄希望于科特迪瓦债券。如此说来，该从哪里获得7%-8%的收益呢？

The good news for firms like Oaktree is that the answer is felt to most likely lie in what have come to be called “alternative investments” (there was no collective term for them when my partners and I started off 30 years ago).  Since essentially no public “beta” markets offer the returns institutions need, many have turned instead to so-called “alpha strategies,” where skillful, active management has the potential to augment market returns, producing what’s needed.

对于像橡树这样的公司来说，一个好消息是，针对上述问题的最有可能的答案是“替代投资”（当我的合作伙伴和我30年前开始创业的时候，对此还没有任何集体术语）。 由于基本上所有公开的“beta策略”都不能够满足机构投资者的需求，因此许多人转向所谓的“alpha策略”，这意味着经验丰富的、激进的管理人有可能获得超额回报以满足他们的收益需求。

But one of the biggest alternatives categories – hedge funds – has been largely discredited as a result of the meager average return over the last dozen years.  And some of the others, like venture capital, are hard to access and too small to absorb much capital.  That brings investors mainly to real estate, distressed debt and, especially, private equity.

但是规模最大的替代品之一——对冲基金，由于过去十几年的平均回报微乎其微，所以基本上被抹黑了。而像风险投资这样的替代品，一方面较难获得，另一方面规模太小以至于无法吸收大量的资本。上述这些情况使得投资者将目光投向于房地产、不良债务，特别是私募股权。

Private equity firms market double-digit return track records, and even their top-of-the-cycle 2005-07 funds now sport respectable gains.  As a result, they’re attracting capital at all-time-high rates:

私募股权投资公司拥有两位数回报的记录，甚至是2005—2007年在市场顶部运行的基金现在也获得了可观的收益。因此，私募股权正在以比任何时候都快的速度吸引资本。

>Private equity is experiencing the best fundraising climate in years – perhaps ever. In the first half of the year, 224 North America-focused funds closed, raising $133 billion, while globally there have been 412 private equity funds closed, which raised a combined $221.4 billion, surpassing slightly the record $220.8 billion raised in 2008, according to Preqin.  (Mergers & Acquisitions newsletter)

>据Preqin报道，私募股权正处于这些年中最好的融资时段——或许是永远。在今年上半年，224个以北美为主的基金封闭，共募集资金133美元。然而在全球范围内，已有412家私募股权基金封闭，总融资额度达2,214亿美元，略高于2008年所创下的2,208亿美元的记录。（《兼并与收购》通讯）

Private equity funds have been raising total capital in the hundreds of billions for the last few years, and even before the latest spate of mega-funds, they already had several hundred billion of “dry powder.”  Importantly, since private equity managers mostly engage in leveraged{:.underline} buyouts, these amounts have to be viewed in terms of the levered-up total capital they’ll produce.  

私募股权基金最近几年的总资本已增长至数百亿美元，它的规模甚至在最新的大型基金之前，并且他们已经有几千亿个“干粉”。更重要的是，私募股权基金经理主要从事杠杆收购，因此必须从杠杆端所能产生的总资本来计算私募股权基金的总规模。

Thus the PE firms will probably add more than a trillion dollars to their buying power this year.  Where will it be invested at a time when few assets can be bought at bargain prices?  Sellers of private companies, too, tend to set asking prices for their firms based on what cash flows are worth in this low-return world.

因此，今年这些PE公司可能会增加超过万亿美元的购买力。当可购买的便宜资产很少时，大体量的PE资金该投向哪里？在低利率背景下，私有企业的卖家也在比较各种形式的现金流的价值从而向市场询价。

I’m not saying private equity isn’t a solution, or even that it’s not the best solution. **It’s just that its record fund-raising is yet one more sign of the willingness of investors to trust in the future.**

我并不否认私募股权可以作为一个解决方案，或者甚至是最好的解决方案，但是其创纪录的筹资规模仍然表明投资者对未来怀有信任的意愿。

### SoftBank Vision Fund(软银愿景基金)

Perhaps the ultimate demonstration of faith in fund managers is SoftBank’s recent raising of $93 billion for its Vision Fund for technology investments – presumably on the way to $100 billion.  SoftBank is a Japanese telecom company showing an 18-year annual return of 44% on investments that have included chipmakers, ride-hailing and telecom.  But I see issues with the fund:

也许最终证明对基金经理还具有信心的标志事件是用于技术投资的软银愿景基金近期升值930亿美元——大约在1000亿美元左右。软银公司（SoftBank）是日本的一家电信公司，其投资范围涵盖芯片制造、乘车和电信，软银公司在近18年来的年均回报率为44%。但我仍看到一些问题：

First, SoftBank’s record of investment success has relied heavily on one phenomenal investment.  The $20 million Softbank invested in Alibaba in 2000 has grown in value to more than $50 billion. **Skill or luck?  And extrapolatable?**

首先，软银公司的投资成功在很大程度上依赖于一项重要的投资：在2000年软银向阿里巴巴投资2000万美元，这部分投资价值现在已经增长到500亿美元。这是靠技术，运气？还是依靠推测的力量？

Second, size matters.  In 1999/2000, the venture capital industry got into trouble because it followed massively successful mid-1990s funds of hundreds of millions, with funds of $1-2 billion.  The Vision Fund isn’t for startups, but still, can you wisely invest $100 billion in technology?

第二，规模问题。在20世纪90年代中期，万亿美元级别的基金大获成功，因此风险投资基金也加入其中，并投资了10-20亿美元，但它也因此在1999-2000年陷入困境：愿景基金的投资对象并不是初创企业，但是在这种情况下，你还能明智地投资1000亿美元到技术领域吗？

Third, here’s an organization that has never managed money for third parties, starting the biggest fund in history to do just that.  Is their experience transferrable? **In all these regards I think the fund indicates a high level of enthusiasm and a low level of skepticism.**

第三，在此之前软银从未管理过第三方资产，而此次成立历史上规模最大的愿景基金进行第一次尝试。他们的经验是否可以借鉴？针对所有这些问题，我认为愿景基金表现出了高层次的积极性和低层次的怀疑精神。

Fourth, and perhaps more importantly for my purposes here, I want to spend some time on the fund’s structure.  For each 38 cents they put into the fund’s equity, outside investors are required to put 62 cents into preferred units of the fund.  On the other hand, SoftBank itself invested $28 billion in equity but nothing in preferred.

第四，也许对我来说更重要的是，也更愿意花时间说明的，是基金会的架构。软银每向基金增加38美分的权益，外部投资者就需要认购62美分的优先份额。换句话说，软银自身投资了280亿美元的权益，但没有任何优先份额。

  - That means when the fund reaches $100 billion, SoftBank will have put up only 28% of the capital but will own 50% of the equity.  Adding in management fees and carried interest, its 28% of the capital may give it 60-70% of the gains.

  这意味着当基金规模达到1000亿美元时，软银将只占28％的资本份额，但将拥有50％的权益。考虑管理费用和附带权益后，软银持有的28％的资本份额可以为它带来60-70％的收益。

  - Even the private equity industry – with its willingness to take risk – has traditionally shied away from piling debt on technology companies (although less so lately).  SoftBank doesn’t hesitate to lever its tech investments.

  即便是愿意承担风险的私有企业，在传统意义上也会回避向科技公司投资 (尽管最近还没有这么做)，然而软银却毫不犹豫地投资于技术领域。

  - The preferred units will pay a 7% annual coupon.Lending money to a tech fund at that modest rate apparently is part of the price demanded of the LPs for an opportunity to invest in the fund’s equity.  I can imagine the sales pitch about how lucky the LPs are to get a chance to provide leverage for their own investment, but I doubt I’d be convinced.

  优先份额将支付7％的年息。很显然，以如此温和的利率借款给技术基金，表明软银的有限合伙人想借此机会投资于这些基金的股权。我可以想象软银的有限合伙人感觉自己多幸运能有机会为自己的投资加杠杆，但我并未被此说服。

  - Finally, as the Financial Times wrote on June 11:

  >While the preferred unit holders will eventually receive their principal back [plus 7% per year], they will only receive [an equity] return for the equity portion of their investment in the fund.

  >All outside backers of the fund are receiving 62 per cent in preferred units and the rest in equity, allowing them to reduce their downside risk, while still generating a good return.

  最后，正如《金融时报》在6月11日写道：

  >Sounds good on the surface.  But how much does this diversion of the investors’ capital into preferred units really reduce their downside risk? **The FT says investors in the preferred units “will eventually receive their principal back.”  Should that really be “will,” or perhaps “may” or “hopefully will”?** Does a $100 million investment in the fund put only the $38 million of equity at risk, or is there risk associated with the preferred, too?  I guess I don’t consider the preferred units as rock-solid as the FT suggests.  Aren’t they more like the Netflix bonds: tech-linked downside with no upside?  Would an arm’s-length lender give an LP money at 7% to lever his equity in this fund 1.6 times?

  >这听起来不错。但是投资者投入的资本优先份额会在多大程度上降低下行风险呢？ 《金融时报》表示，优先份额的投资者“最终会收回他们的本金”，这是“会”、“可能”还是“希望”？对该基金投资的1亿美元只会让3800万美元的权益部分暴露风险，还是说优先份额也会暴露在风险之中？我认为优先单元并不像《金融时报》所声称的那样坚如磐石。他们岂不更像Netflix的债券：技术链下滑，没有上涨空间？一个正常的贷款人会以7％的利率向有限合伙人放贷，从而将自己的权益杠杆放大到1.6倍吗？

**The willingness of investors to invest in a shockingly large fund for levered tech investing with a questionable structure is a further indication of an exuberant, unquestioning market.**

投资者为了利用杠杆技术而投资于一个令人震惊的、架构存疑的大型基金进一步表明目前的市场是一个繁荣的、没有怀疑情绪的市场。

### Digital Currencies(数字货币)

The discussion of innovative investments brings me to Bitcoin, Ether and other digital currencies.  I’d guess these things have arisen from the intersection of (a) doubts about financial security – including the value of national currencies – that grew out of the financial crisis and (b) the comfort felt by millennials regarding all things virtual.  But they’re not real.

关于创新投资的讨论使我想到了比特币、以太币和其他数字货币。我猜测这些数字货币是基于以下两点的交叉影响而产生的：（1）从金融危机中衍生的对于金融安全的疑虑（包括对本国货币的价值），（2）千百年来所有虚拟物品都带来的舒适体验。但他们并不真实。

Some businesses accept Bitcoin as payment.  Some buyers want to own Ether because it can be used to pay for computing power on the Ethereum network.  Some people are eager to speculate on digital currency for profit.  Others want to put a little money into these to-date-profitable phenomena rather than run the risk of missing out.  But they’re not real!

有些企业接受以比特币作为支付方式。有些买家希望拥有以太币，因为它可以用来支付以太网的计算功能。有些人渴望通过投机数字货币来牟利，其他人则想少量投资于这些最近在盈利的项目，而不是白白错失机会。但他们并不真实！

People tell me these currencies are solid, because (a) they’re secure against hacking and counterfeiting and (b) the software used to generate them strictly limits the amount that can be created.  But they’re not real!!!!!  Nobody has been able to make sense to me of these currencies.  Here are a few paragraphs on Ether from The New York Times of June 19:

有些人认为数字货币是坚固的，因为（1）他们很安全，可以防止黑客和伪造的侵犯，（2）用于生成它们的软件数量受严格限制。但他们并不真实!!!!! 没有人能够说服我认同这数字货币的意义。以下是《纽约时报》在6月19日报道的关于以太坊的部分段落：

>The sudden rise of Ethereum highlights how volatile the bewildering world of virtual currency remains, where lines of code can be spun into billions of dollars in a matter of months. . . .

>以太币的突然崛起凸显了虚拟货币所在的令人迷乱的世界是多么波动，在这里几行代码在几个月内可以转化为数十亿美元……

>Ethereum was launched in the middle of 2015 by a 21-year-old college dropout, Vitalik Buterin . . .  Mr. Buterin was inspired by Bitcoin, and the software he built shares some of the same basic qualities.  Both are hosted and maintained by the computers of volunteers around the world, who are rewarded for their participation with new digital tokens that are released into the network every day.

>以太坊由一个21岁的大学辍学者布特林（Vitalik Buterin）在2015年年中创建。布特林先生创建以太坊的灵感来自于比特币，以太币的部分软件也与比特币共享一些相同属性。以太币和比特币都由世界各地的志愿者所享有和维护，而这些志愿者会被奖励可以每天发布到网络中的新的数字令牌。

>Because the virtual currencies are tracked and maintained by a network of computers, no government or company is in charge.  The prices of both Bitcoin and Ether are established on private exchanges, where people can sell the tokens they own at the going market price. . . .

>由于这些虚拟货币被网络用户所持有和维护，没有任何的政府机构和企业组织对其进行管理。比特币和以太币的价格都是通过私下交易的形式确定，这样人们就可以在市场价格上涨期间出售手中的数字令牌。

>Many [new currency] applications being built on Ethereum are also raising money using the Ether currency, in what are known as initial coin offerings, a play on initial public offerings.

>以太坊中的许多（新货币）的用户也在使用以太币筹资，即“首次硬币发行”，这是IPO（首次公开发行）的玩法。

>Start-ups that have followed this path have generally collected Ether from investors and exchanged them for units of their own specialized virtual currency, leaving the entrepreneurs with the Ether to convert into dollars and spend on operational expenses.

>遵循这条路径的初创企业一般从投资者处收集以太坊并用以交换专享虚拟货币单位，这些企业将以太坊兑换为美元并支付运营成本。

>These coin offerings, which have proliferated in recent months, have created a surge of demand for the Ether currency.  Just last week, investors sent $150 million worth of Ether to a start-up, Bancor, that wants to make it easier to launch virtual currencies.

>近几个月来虚拟货币数量激增，这激发了市场对于以太坊的需求。就在上周，投资者向初创企业Bancor出资价值为1.5亿美元的以太币，以帮助其更容易启动虚拟货币的运营。

Bottom line: you can use the imaginary currency Ether to buy other new imaginary currencies, or to invest in new companies that will create other new currencies.  In “bubble.com,” I highlighted some illogical aspects of e-commerce by including some of my father’s old jokes regarding how to make money.  Here’s another that seems 100% appropriate for the digital currency movement:

底线：你可以使用虚拟的以太币购买其他的虚拟货币，或者投资于可以产生新货币的企业。在《bubble.com》中，我曾利用父亲讲过的关于如何赚钱的老笑话来强调电子货币中不和逻辑的地方。这里是另一个似乎完全适合数字货币的笑话：

>Two guys meet in the street.  Joe tells Bob about the hamster he has for sale: pedigreed and highly intelligent.  Bob says he’d like to buy a hamster for his kid: “How much is it?”  Joe answers, “half a million,” and Bob tells him he’s crazy.

两个小伙子乔和鲍勃在街上相遇。乔告诉鲍勃关于他出售的仓鼠：纯熟而高度智能化。鲍勃说他想为他的孩子买一只仓鼠：“多少钱？”乔回答说：“五十万”，鲍勃说乔很疯狂。

>They meet again the next day.  “How’d you do with that hamster?”  Bob asks.  “Sold it,” says Joe.  “Did you get $500,000?” Bob asks.  “Sure,” says Joe.  “Cash?”  “No,” Joe answers, “I took two $250,000 canaries.”

第二天他们又遇见了。“你的仓鼠怎么样了”，鲍勃问道。“卖掉了”，乔说。“卖了五十万吗？”鲍勃问道。“是的”，乔说。“现金？”“不是，”乔回答道，“我收了两个25万美元的金丝雀。”

One of my very favorite quotes concerning the market’s foibles, from John Kenneth Galbraith, says that in euphoric times, **“past experience, to the extent that it is part of memory at all, is dismissed as the primitive refuge of those who do not have the insight to appreciate the incredible wonders of the present.”**

我最喜欢的一句关于市场缺陷的话，是引用自约翰·肯尼思·加尔布雷思（John Kenneth Galbraith），他在那个幸福的年代说到“过去的经验，只要它完全成为记忆的一部分，就会被放弃，因为它可以作为没有洞察力去欣赏现在难以置信的奇迹的那部分人的原始避难所。”

Maybe I’m just a dinosaur, too technologically backward to appreciate the greatness of digital currency. But it is my firm view that **the ability of these things to gain acceptance is just one more proof of the prevalence today of financial naiveté, willing risk-taking and wishful thinking.**

也许我只是一只恐龙，技术观念过于落后以至于难以欣赏数字货币的伟大。但是我坚信，这些数字货币能够获得认可只能证明更多的证据表明今天的金融幼稚的盛行，以及愿意冒险和一厢情愿的思维。

**In my view, digital currencies are nothing but an unfounded fad (or perhaps even a pyramid scheme), based on a willingness to ascribe value to something that has little or none beyond what people will pay for it.** But this isn’t the first time.  The same description can be applied to the Tulip mania that peaked in 1637, the South Sea Bubble (1720) and the Internet Bubble (1999-2000).

在我看来，数字货币只不过是一个毫无根据的时尚（甚至是金字塔方案），基于将估值归功于价值很少甚至没有任何价值事物，使人们为此付出代价。但这并不是第一次了。相同的事件可以应用于郁金香在1637年达到的狂热顶峰，南海泡泡（1720）以及互联网泡沫（1999-2000）。

**Serious investing consists of buying things because the price is attractive relative to intrinsic value.  Speculation, on the other hand, occurs when people buy something without any consideration of its underlying value or the appropriateness of its price, solely because they think others will pay more for it in the future.**

严谨的投资考虑到了物品的定价相对于其内在价值具有吸引力这一因素。或者另一方面，当人们仅仅考虑到别人会为这些东西支付更高的价格时，这些人会忽略这些事物的潜在价值或恰当的价值而选择购买。

It isn’t unreasonable for someone to use Bitcoin to pay for something – or for a seller to accept Bitcoin in payment – based on an agreement between the parties: barter takes place all the time.  But does that make it “currency”?

根据双方之间的协议，使用比特币来支付或者用比特币来收款的人并非不理性，易货交易发生在所有时间。但这是否使它成为“货币”？

**The price of Bitcoin has more than doubled since the start of the year.  Can something that does that seriously be considered a “medium of exchange” or “store of value,” rather than the subject of a speculative mania?** Maybe not, but Bitcoin looks staid in comparison to Ether, which has appreciated 4,500% so far this year.  The outstanding Ether is now worth 82% as much as all the Bitcoin in the world, up from 5% at the beginning of the year.

比特币的价格自今年年初以来翻了一番。它真的可以被认为是“交换媒介”或“价值储存”，而不是狂躁投机的主题吗？也许不是。但是与以太币相比，比特币表现更为稳定：今年以来已经升值了4,500％。优异的以太币现在比世界上所有的比特币都高出82％，高于年初的5％。

The New York Times notes that together, the outstanding Bitcoin and Ether are worth more than Paypal and almost as much as Goldman Sachs.  Would you rather own all of the two digital currencies or one of those companies?  In other words, are these currencies’ values real?  They’re likely to keep working as long as optimism is present, but their performance in bad times is far from dependable. **What will happen to Bitcoin’s price and liquidity in a crisis if people decide they’d rather hold dollars (or gold)?**

与此同时，《纽约时报》指出，优质的比特币和以太币的价值比贝宝的价值还要高，甚至与高盛齐平。你愿意拥有这两种数字货币抑或其中一家公司吗？换句话说，这些货币的价值是真实的吗？ 只要乐观主义存在，他们就可能继续有效，但是他们在恶劣时期的表现相当不可靠。如果人们更愿意持有美元（或黄金），这会对比特币的价值和流动性产生什么影响？

### We Agree, But . . .(我们同意，但是……)

Andrew told me about a conversation he had recently with some fund managers, in which he went over a lot of what I’m discussing here.  Given today’s conditions, their response started predictably: “We agree, but . . .”

我的儿子安德鲁告知了我他最近与一些基金经理的谈话，在谈话中他也涉及到了很多我这里讨论的话题。在今天的环境之下，他们的回答开始陷入老套，“我们对此表示同意，但是……”

We hear a lot of that these days:

- We agree, but the things we’re doing offer higher returns than the rest.

- We agree, but cash isn’t an option when it returns nearly nothing.

- We agree, but we can’t take the risk of being out of the market.

- We agree, but there’s no alternative.

**Investors should choose their risk posture based on an assessment of what’s being offered in terms of absolute return, absolute risk, and thus absolute risk-adjusted return.  But today – on that famous other hand – investors generally don’t have the luxury of holding out for absolute returns and safety like they enjoyed in the past.**

投资者本应该在评估一项投资提供了怎样的绝对收益、绝对风险、绝对风险调整后收益的基础上选择他们的风险态度。但如今恰好相反，投资者常常无法像过去那样。享受为获得绝对收益和安全性而进行投资的奢侈待遇。

Many of the things I’ve highlighted above offer good returns and risk premiums relative to the returns on Treasurys and high grade debt.  But (a) low rates may be – generally are expected to be – a temporary condition and (b) it might be wiser to gauge reward in absolute terms. **The bottom line is that while the prices and prospective returns on many things are justifiable today relative to other things, you can’t eat (or spend) relative returns.**

我上面强调的很多投资相比于国债和高等级债券来说，都提供了更好的收益和风险溢价。但是（1）低利率也许是——而且普遍被预期是——一种短期现象，（2）从绝对的角度来测度回报也许更明智一些。虽然相比较于其他投资，目前许多资产的价格和预期收益还属正常，但你不一定能获得这个相对收益。

Everyone’s investing on the basis of relatives these days; they see no alternative.  But that reminds me of former Citigroup CEO Chuck Prince, who gained fame in the months leading up to the Global Financial Crisis for saying of the bank’s leveraged lending practices, “When the music stops, in terms of liquidity, things will be complicated.  But as long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance.  We’re still dancing.” **Today I think most investors know the good times will end someday, as Prince did, but for now they feel they, too, have no choice but to dance.**

每个人都在进行相对投资，他们没有办法。这让我想起了前花旗总裁 Chuck Prince，他因为全球金融危机爆发前的几个月里发表的关于银行杠杆借贷实践的言论而声名鹊起，“当音乐停止时，由于流动性的问题，事情会变得相当复杂。但只要音乐继续，我们就得站起来跳舞。我们现在仍处于跳舞之中。”我想现在很多投资者们都像Prince一样，清楚地认识到好日子终有一天会结束，但是当下他们认为自己没有选择而只能跳舞。

And there’s one other thing we hear a lot these days:

而且这些天我们也反复听到另一件事情：

>We agree things can’t go well forever – we agree the cycle is extended, prices are elevated and uncertainty is high – but we don’t see anything that’s likely to bring the bull market to a close anytime soon.

> 我们都知道事情不可能永远走好——我们同意周期被延长，价格被抬升，而且不确定性很高——但在近期我们并没有看到任何牛市结束的信号。

In other words, there’ll be a time for caution, just not today.  In that connection, Andrew reminds me about Saint Augustine, who said: “Give me chastity and continence, but not yet.” **Is there something other than the punitive returns on safe assets that keeps this from being a time for caution?**

换句话说，当然有需要谨慎的时期，但不是现在。在这方面，安德鲁提醒了我圣奥古斯丁（Saint Augustine）的一句话，他说：“给我贞洁和自制，但不是现在。”还有什么能比无风险资产的惩罚性回报更能使现在的人放弃谨慎呢？

### Observations and Implications(观察和启示)

As I said, most of the phenomena described above seem reasonable given the rest of what’s going on in today’s economic and financial world.  But step back for perspective and put them together, and what do we see?

就像我说的，大多数上文我所描述的现象在当今的金融和经济环境继续持续的前提下看起来是合理的。但退一步来看，把它们放在一起，我们看到的是什么呢？

- Some of the highest equity valuations in history.(一些历史上最高的股票估值。)

- The so-called VIX index of fear at an all-time low.(所谓的自满指数创历史新高。)

- The elevation of a can’t-lose group of stocks.(“不可能跑输”股票组合的重仓。)

- The movement of more than a trillion dollars into value-agnostic investing.(超过一万亿美元进入到投资价值不可知的被动投资中去)

- The lowest yields in history on low-rated bonds and loans.(低评级债券和贷款创历史上收益率新低。)

- Yields on emerging market debt that are lower still.(新兴市场债券收益率仍然走低。)

- The most fundraising in history for private equity.(私募基金资金筹集创历史新高。)

- The biggest fund of all time raised for levered tech investing.(历史上规模最大的基金（软银）正在科技领域疯狂加杠杆)

- Billions in digital currencies whose value has multiplied dramatically.(数十亿美元的数字货币价值急剧增加。)

**I absolutely am not saying stocks are too high, the FAANGs will falter, credit investing is risky, digital currencies are sure to end up worthless, or private equity commitments won’t pay off.  All I’m saying is that for all the things listed above to simultaneously be gaining in popularity and attracting so much capital, credulousness has to be high and risk aversion has to be low.  It’s not that these things are doomed, just that their returns may not fully justify their risk.  And, more importantly, that they show the temperature of today’s market to be elevated.  Not a nonsensical bubble – just high and therefore risky.**

**我绝不是在说股票价格太高了，FAANGs会动摇，信用投资具有风险，数字化货币最终会一文不值，私募股权的回报承诺不一定能够兑现等。我所说的只是上述所有资产都在变得更受欢迎并吸引如此多的资本，轻信度在上升，而风险规避意识在削弱。并不说他们会注定有此结局，只是他们的收益也许并无法涵盖他们的风险。而且更重要的是，他们显示了市场的升温，并不一定是个疯狂的泡沫，只是价格高所以风险高。**

Try to think of the things that could knock today’s market off kilter, like a surprising spike in inflation, a significant slowdown in growth, central banks losing control, or the big tech stocks running into trouble.  The good news is that they all seem unlikely.  The bad news is that their unlikelihood causes all these concerns to be dismissed, leaving the markets susceptible should any of them actually occur. **That means this is a market in which riskiness is being tolerated and perhaps ignored, and one in which most investors are happy to bear risk.  Thus it’s not one in which we should do so.**

想想那些能使今天的市场失衡的因素，比如通货膨胀率出人意料的增长，经济增长的大幅放缓，中央银行丧失控制力，或大型科技股公司陷入困境。好消息是，这些似乎都不太可能发生。坏消息是，他们的不可能性使所有这些担忧都消失，进而使得市场在这些因素中任何一个爆发时都会相当敏感。这意味着在市场中，风险是被容许的，甚至是被忽视的，市场中的投资者都非常乐于承担风险，而他们本来并不应该如此。

What else:

- My observations are always indicative, not predictive. **The usual consequences of the conditions I describe – like an eventual increase in risk aversion – should happen, but they don’t have to happen.**

  我的观察是指示性的，而不是预测性的。我所描述的条件带来的一般意义上的后果，比如风险厌恶的最终增加，应该发生，但他们不一定会发生。

- **And they certainly don’t have to happen soon.** No one knows anything about timing.Certain consequences are implied, but even if they’re going to happen, we have no way of knowing when.It feels like we’re in the eighth inning, but I have no idea how long the game will go on.

  而且他们当然也不一定很快发生。没有人知道时点。某些后果还是隐性的，因此即使他们会发生，我们也无法知道。这就像虽然我们已经进入了第八局，但却不知道比赛还会持续多久。

- **I’m never sure of my market observations.** As you’ll see in my new book, I believe strongly that where we are in a cycle says a lot about the market’s likely tendencies, but I never state opinions on this subject with high confidence.

  我不能确保我的市场观察正确。正如你们在我的新书中看到的一样，我坚信，我们在周期中所处的位置能说明许多市场发展可能的趋势，但我从未对这个问题发表过高度自信的见解。

- **As a natural worrier, I tend to be early with warnings,** as described on page one.  'Nuff said.

  作为一个生而忧患的人，我往往过早警惕，正如第一页上描述的那样。

- **Finally, while my observations are uncertain and should be taken with a grain of salt, what I am sure of is that valuations and markets are elevated, and the easy money in this cycle has been made.**

  最后，虽然我的观察不一定是确切的，需要对之保持一定的怀疑精神，但我可以肯定的是估值和市场的抬升，以及这个周期已经创造了获得“容易钱”的机会。

### What to Do(怎么办)

To me, the four components of the current environment listed on pages 2 and 3 – high uncertainty, low prospective returns, high prices and pro-risk behavior – are indisputable.  The question is whether you agree.  If so, I trust you’ll grant that they make for a troubling combination.  Markets normally respond to elevated uncertainty with lower asset prices and compensatorily higher returns.  But not today.  Thus we’re living in a low-return, high-risk world.  Period.

对我来说，第2页和第3页列出的当前环境的四个组成部分——高不确定性、低预期收益、高价格和风险偏好行为——是无可争议的。问题是你是否同意。如果你同意，我相信你会承认他们的组合比较麻烦。市场通常用更低的资产价格和更高的补偿性回报来应对不确定性的上升。但如今却不是这样，我们活在一个低回报、高风险的环境和时期。

For that reason, this might seem like an attractive time to refrain from investing, or at least from bearing risk.  However, organizations for which investing is an essential part of the business model – like pension funds, insurance companies, endowments and sovereign wealth funds – generally don’t have the option to not invest.  That’s especially true when the return on cash is as low as it is today.

这样看来，现在似乎是一个很好的时机来抑制投资，或者至少抑制风险的承担。然而，对于那些将投资做为商业模式重要组成部分的机构，比如养老基金、保险公司、捐赠基金和主权财富基金来说，一般都没有不去投资的选择权。当现金回报率和当前一样低时，情况尤其如此。

**Further, the case for cash that can be built today from all the above could have been made years ago, and doing so would have resulted in huge penalties.** Oaktree’s investment philosophy generally causes us to eschew the raising and lowering of cash.  We might make an exception in extraordinary circumstances, but today doesn’t seem to warrant doing so. **Instead, Oaktree will continue to follow its 2012 mantra: “move forward, but with caution” – and, given today’s conditions, with even more caution than in the recent past.  If one is going to invest at times like this, investment professionalism – knowing how to bear risk intelligently, striving for return while keeping an eagle-eye on the potential adverse consequences – is the absolute sine qua non.**

从上面的分析可以看出，现在应该持有现金，但如果你几年前这么做的话，就会错失风险资产的上涨收益。橡树资本的投资理念通常使我们避开了提高和降低现金比例的选择。在特殊情况下，我们可能会破例，但目前看来并不应该这样做。相反，橡树资本将继续遵循其2012的宗旨：“前进，但必须谨慎”，并且鉴于当前的环境，甚至要比以往更加谨慎。如果你想在这样的时候投资，投资专业性——知道在对潜在的不利后果保持警惕的前提下，明智地承担风险，追求回报——绝对是必要条件。

Environments like today’s call to mind the applicability of something I was told more than 40 years ago by Sid Cottle, editor of the later editions of Graham and Dodd’s Security Analysis: **“Investment is the discipline of relative selection.”** I interpret that to mean we have no alternative but to choose from among the available options based on their relative merit.

今天这样的环境让我想起了40多年前Sid Cottle告诉我的某些适用的道理，他是格雷厄姆和多德的《证券分析》后面几期的编辑，他说“投资是相对选择的训练”。我将之解读为我们不得不基于相对优势在可供选择的选项中做出选择。

[“There They Go Again”](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/2005-05-06-there-they-go-again.pdf) was written in May 2005, at the front end of a string of cautionary memos leading up to the last cyclical peak.  It was the first time I explicitly raised the question – too early as usual – of how one should invest in a low-return world.  I went on to list a few possibilities, none of which was sure to work, but I concluded with the one thing I was convinced of:

《重蹈覆辙》一文写在2005年5月，这篇备忘录是上述一系列警示性备忘录中离上一轮周期顶峰最近的一篇。这是我第一次像往常一样早早地明确提出这一问题——我们应该如何在低回报的环境中投资。我继续列举了几种可能答案，可没有一种确定能起作用，但有一件事情我很确信：

>. . . there’s no easy answer for investors faced with skimpy prospective returns and risk premiums.  But there is one course of action – one classic mistake – that I most strongly feel is wrong: reaching for return.

>……对于投资者所面临的预期收益不足和风险溢出的问题并没有简单的解决方法，但有一种行动——一种经典的错误——我强烈认为那是错误的，那就是追求收益。

**The events of 2007 and 2008 showed this observation to have been prudent and appropriate.  And given today’s similarities to the last cycle, I think it’s applicable again.**

2007和2008年的事件表明，这一观察是审慎和适当的。考虑到今天与上一个周期的相似性，我认为它再次适用。

Here’s a great observation on the subject from Berkshire-Hathaway’s 2010 letter to shareholders:

在2010年伯克希尔哈撒韦公司给股东的信中对这个问题有一个很好的观点：

>We agree with investment writer Ray DeVoe’s observation, “More money has been lost reaching for yield than at the point of a gun.”

> 我们同意投资作家Ray DeVoe的评论，“相比于枪口之下，更多的钱在追求收益的过程中损失掉了。”

Or as Peter Bernstein put it, “The market is not an accommodating machine; it won’t give you high returns just because you need them.”

或者，正如Peter Bernstein所说，“市场不是一个收容所，它不会因为你需要高回报而给你高回报。

**The key strategic decision for anyone shaping investment strategy is whether to apply aggressiveness or defensiveness at a given point in time.** In other words, should we worry more today about losing money or about missing opportunity?  The answer at all times depends on what’s available in the investment environment.

任何人的投资战略的关键决策都是在给定的时间点选择激进还是防御。换句话说，我们今天应该更担心亏钱还是更担心错过机会？这一答案始终取决于在现下的投资环境中什么是可得的。

- I have no doubt that the ascent to the apex from which the Global Financial Crisis took place was powered by the willing acceptance of risk in the low-return world of 2004-07. **In other words, excessive risk tolerance and the resulting incautious behavior provided the foundation for the vast losses experienced in the move from peak to trough.**

  我毫不怀疑，全球金融危机爆发时的高位是由2004-2007年低回报环境中的风险偏好所推动的。换句话说，过度的风险容忍和由此产生的轻率行为导致了为从高峰跌到低谷的巨大损失。

- And in the trough of late 2008/early ’09, I likewise have no doubt that most investors were saying, “I don’t care if I ever make another penny in the market; I just don’t want to lose any more.Get me out!” **Their excessive risk aversion created the opportunity for the huge returns enjoyed in the recovery.**

  在2008年底和2009年初的低谷期，我也毫不怀疑大多数投资者都在说，“我并不在乎是否能在市场上多赚一分钱；我只是不想再损失任何钱。让我出去！”而他们的过度风险厌恶创造了复苏期巨大的回报。

**Where are we today?  As I said earlier, risk is high and prospective return is low, and the low prospective returns on safe investments are pushing people into taking risk – which they’re willing
to do – at a time when the reward for doing so is low.**

我们现在在什么位置呢？正如我前面所说的，风险是高的，预期收益是低的，而且安全投资的低预期收益推动着人们进一步承担风险，尽管此时这样做的回报是很低的。

Given my view of the environment, the only reason to be aggressive today is because defensive investing implies low prospective returns.  But the question is whether pursuing high expected returns through aggressiveness can be counted on to be rewarded.  If the answer is no, as I believe, then this is a time for caution.

假定我对环境的看法是正确的，那么如今激进投资的唯一原因是防御性投资的低预期回报。但问题是，通过激进投资追求高预期收益是否能够得到回报。如果答案是否定的，那么我相信这是一个需要警惕的时候了。

That doesn’t mean you have to be content with a low-return portfolio.  If you need returns higher than those available in the beta markets at the low-risk end of the spectrum, it is reasonable to move into riskier asset classes. **But for every asset class, there are high-risk and low-risk approaches.  When the market is rational, low-risk investments will always appear to offer prospective returns lower than those on high-risk ones.  But in tough times, the former are less likely to bring losses than the latter.  In my opinion that makes them right for today.**

这并不意味着你必须投资低回报的投资组合。如果你需要在低风险端获得高于市场可得的Beta收益的回报，那么进入风险更高的资产类别是合理的。但对于每一个资产类别，都有高风险和低风险的投资方法。如果市场是理性的，低风险投资总是比高风险投资提供更低的预期收益。但是，在困难时期，前者带来损失的可能性比后者更低。因此我觉得他们更为适合当下。

Perhaps the best way to understand investment cycles is through that great statement attributed to Mark Twain: “History doesn’t repeat, but it does rhyme.”  The duration, pace, amplitude and details of each investment cycle are different from those of its predecessors, but the basic themes and essential ingredients are usually vaguely familiar.  What Twain calls rhyming history I describe as “common threads.”

也许马克吐温的伟大表述才是理解投资周期的最好方式，他说：“历史不会重演，但它确实押韵。” 每个投资周期的久期，速度，振幅和细节与之前都不同，但主题和关键却常常是似曾相识的。吐温称之为“押韵的历史”，而我把它描述为“共同线程”。

The themes or threads that repeatedly characterize too-bullish markets are the ones listed on page 4. **While they don’t all have to be present for a top, bull market or boom to form, (a) usually many are present when one does and (b) it’s hard for a full-throated bubble to come into existence without them.  They truly are the raw materials for market excesses on the upside.**

我将用来反复描述过热市场的主题或主线在第4页上列出。虽然在顶部、牛市或繁荣形成的时候，它们不一定都出现，但（1）通常大多数都出现，（2）没有它们，一个喧嚣的泡沫很难持续存在。因此它们确实是市场过热的原材料。

On the other hand, the keys to avoiding the classic mistakes also recur, and I listed them in [“There They Go Again”](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/2005-05-06-there-they-go-again.pdf):

另一方面，也有避免经典错误的关键，我把它们列在《重蹈覆辙》中：

- awareness of history,(保持历史意识)

- belief in cycles rather than unabated, unidirectional trends,(信仰周期而不是持续的单向趋势，)

- skepticism regarding the free lunch, and(对免费的午餐保持怀疑)

- insistence on low purchase prices that provide lots of room for error.(坚持低价买入，为错误提供更多安全边际。)

**坚持防御性投资的所有标准，无疑会让你错过牛市中最激动人心的部分，特别是当趋势达到非理性的极端并且价格过度偏度内在价值时。但他们也会让你成为一个长期的幸存者。我不能不认为这是成功投资的一个先决条件。**

The checklist for market sanity and safety is simple, and the answers will tell you what to do:

检查市场的稳健性与安全性是很简单的，以下问题的答案会告诉你该做什么：

- Are prospective returns adequate?(预期收益足够高吗？)

- Are investors appropriately risk-averse?(投资者的风险厌恶恰当么？)

- Are they applying skepticism and discipline?(投资者保持着怀疑精神和纪律性吗？)

- Are they demanding sufficient risk premiums?(投资者要求足够的风险溢价么？)

- Are valuations reasonable relative to historic standards?(从历史标准来看这些估值合理么？)

- Are deal structures fair to investors?(交易结构对投资者公平吗？)

- Are investors declining any of the new deals?(投资者有拒绝任何新的交易么？)

- Are there limits on faith in the future?(对未来的信心有界限么？)

**The basic proposition is simple: Investors make the most and the safest money when they do things other people don’t want to do.  But when investors are unworried and glad to make risky investments (or worried but investing anyway, because the low-risk alternatives are unappealing), asset prices will be high, risk premiums will be low, and markets will be risky.  That’s what happens when there’s too much money and too little fear.**

**最终的基本命题很简单：当投资者做别人不想做的事情时，他们赚的钱是最多也是最安全的。但当投资者毫无恐惧、高高兴兴做风险投资时（或虽然有担忧，但因为低风险投资的吸引力太低，所以仍然选择风险投资时），资产价格会很高，风险溢价会很低，这时市场是危险的。这就是当钱太多、恐惧太少时会发生的事情。**


I’ll close with a final “ditto,” from [“The Race to the Bottom”](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/2007-02-14-the-race-to-the-bottom.pdf) of just over ten years ago:

我将用10年前《趋底竞赛》一书中相似的观点来作为结语:

>If you refuse to fall into line in carefree markets like today’s, it’s likely that, for a while, you’ll (a) lag in terms of return and (b) look like an old fogey.  But neither of those is much of a price to pay if it means keeping your head (and capital) when others eventually lose theirs.  In my experience, times of laxness have always been followed eventually by corrections in which penalties are imposed.  It may not happen this time, but I’ll take that risk.  In the meantime, Oaktree and its people will continue to apply the standards that have served us so well over the last [thirty] years.

>如果你拒绝进入今天这样看似毫无忧虑的市场，很可能在短期内，你会（1）在回报上滞后于他人，（2）看起来像一个老头子。但是相对于活命（保持资本）来说，这两者的代价实在不高。从我的经验来看，一次次的迟缓懈怠终究会被施加于它的惩罚所纠正。这一次它也许不会发生，但我愿意承担这样的风险。与此同时，橡树资本和它的员工会继续秉持使我们在过去（三十）年获益良多的投资准则。
